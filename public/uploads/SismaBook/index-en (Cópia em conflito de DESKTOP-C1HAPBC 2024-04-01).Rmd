|       **Sisma** is a program designed to generate dynamic visualizations of transformations occurring between reactants and products in chemical reactions. This user-friendly software facilitates the creation of reaction pathways by allowing the simple insertion of compounds (*objects*) linked by arrows (*paths*). This intuitive design mimics the traditional approach of drawing reaction schemes with a pencil and paper.

|       Written in Java, Sisma enables researchers to dynamically visualize and evaluate the transformation of reactants and products in various contexts, including isolated reactions, metabolic flows, and intricate reaction maps. The name *Sisma* itself is an acronym for "Sistema de Mapas Autocatalíticos" (Autocatalytic Map System). The program performs a unique combined visual and quantitative simulation on a reaction map. It achieves this by capturing variations in the color intensity of the objects involved in each transformation, based on either a pre-defined equation or a user-defined one.

### Features of Sisma:

* Comprehensive Object Management: Allows for the insertion of compounds (objects), pathways (paths), additional figures, and annotations directly onto the reaction map.
* Data Persistence: Enables the storage and retrieval of created reaction maps for future reference and analysis.
* Dynamic Concentration Simulation: Simulates variations in the relative concentrations of each compound using a combination of dot graphs and lines, providing a real-time visualization alongside the map itself.
* Interactive Simulation Control: Offers functionalities for pausing, interrupting, rewinding, and advancing the visualization at any point during the simulation.
* Quantitative Data Export: Automatically generates and exports a spreadsheet containing the numerical values of each object transformed at each time step.
* Instantaneous Map Printing: Allows for the immediate printing of the reaction map at a specific point of interest during the transformation process.

Through these functionalities, Sisma transforms the static presentation of forces and flows typically found in diagrams and maps within *Biochemistry* and related fields into a dynamic and interactive experience.

### Development:

The program was developed collaboratively by a team led by Prof. DSc. Luiz Eduardo da Silva from the Department of Computer Science (DCC/UNIFAL-MG) and three undergraduate students participating in a Scientific Initiation program.

### Download
Download and Installation:

The compressed file containing the Sisma program can be downloaded from the following [SISMA link](.\Sisma.zip).

#### Quick Usage Guide:

|       Download: Download the Sisma program from the provided link above (LINK: .\Sisma.zip).
* Extraction: Unzip the downloaded file on your personal computer.
* Java Virtual Machine: Sisma does not require formal installation. However, it necessitates a *Java Virtual Machine (JVM)* to run. You can download and install the latest version of Java from the [official website](https://www.java.com/pt-BR/download/manual.jsp).
* Execution: Navigate to the "dist" folder within the extracted files and double-click the Java executable file named **"Sisma_Realese_1.jar"**.

### Video Tutorial (in Portuguese):

|       A short video tutorial (quick tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPr5zWlJqbY) is available to illustrate the program's usage further.

### Basic Usage:

* Object Insertion: Right-click on the program's interface and select "Object" to insert a compound representation.
* Multiple Objects: Repeat the object insertion process (step 1) in another location on the program's workspace, adjusting the color intensity using the provided scroll bar if desired.
* Connecting Objects: Click and hold on a vertex (connection point) of one object, drag the mouse cursor to a vertex of the other object, and release to establish a connection between them.
* Simulation Initiation: Click "OK" after completing the object placement and connection. Subsequently, click the "Play" icon to initiate the simulation, which will visually demonstrate the color transition between the connected objects.
