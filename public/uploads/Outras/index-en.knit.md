|      The following *resources* provide access to a variety of interactive learning tools and software applications designed to enhance teaching and learning in Biochemistry and related fields. These resources typically require some user interaction to facilitate active engagement with the learning material.

 <br />

[Protein Purification](http://www.agbooth.com/pp_ajax/){target="\_blank"}. This online tool (also available for Android and iPhone) simulates protein fractionation processes utilizing various techniques.

[EnzLab](https://download.cnet.com/EnzLab-for-Windows-32-bit/3000-2054_4-76136182.html){target="\_blank"}.A software program compatible with Windows and Mac computers, EnzLab simulates laboratory activities involving enzyme kinetics and inhibition experiments. 

[Biuret Method for Protein Determination](https://www.bdc.ib.unicamp.br/bdc/visualizarMaterial.php?idMaterial=1342){target="\_blank"}.  This online simulation tool demonstrates the assay for protein determination using the principle of molecular absorption (Biuret method).

[iMolView](https://www.molsoft.com/iMolview.html){target="\_blank"}. Designed for Android devices, iMolView is a mobile application that enables users to visualize molecules in 3D. The application accesses data from various databases, including NCBI, PDB, and DrugBank.

<!-- [LudoKrebs: Learning Biochemistry in a Fun Way](LudoKrebs: aprendendo bioquímica de um modo divertido){target="\_blank"}. This board game provides an engaging approach to learning about energy metabolism. -->

[Serological Determination of Antigen by ELISA](https://media.hhmi.org/biointeractive/vlabs/immunology/index.html){target="\_blank"}. This online tool simulates an ELISA experiment used to identify lupus erythematosus, providing an interactive learning experience for understanding immunological techniques.

[BDC - Unicamp Digital Science Library](https://www.bdc.ib.unicamp.br/bdc/busca.php?tipoMaterial=a%3A1%3A%7Bi%3A0%3Bs%3A8%3A%22software%22%3B%7D&acao=exibirCategoria){target="\_blank"}. This brazilian portal at UNICAMP-SP provides access to a comprehensive collection of software applications relevant to various fields within Biochemistry.

[COM4 - Simulation of Mitochondrial Consumption (Android/iPhone) - LTE/Unicamp](https://www.lte.ib.unicamp.br/portal/apps.php?idApp=7). COM4 is an interactive simulation application (available for Android and iPhone) designed to explore mitochondrial consumption processes.

[LTE - Unicamp Educational Technology Laboratory](https://www.lte.ib.unicamp.br/portal/). This portal serves as a repository for various educational technology applications relevant to Biochemistry education, including COM4 (mentioned above) and ARMET (an augmented reality application also available for Android and iPhone).
