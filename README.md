Bioquanti website was designed to contribute to reproducible and self-instructional teaching. Reproducible teaching is understood as an active teaching-learning methodology based on programming codes, inherited from Donald Knuth’s concepts of literate programming and reproducible research, and aimed at the production and sharing of dynamic documents and teaching objects. Originally designed for the study of topics in Quantitative Biochemistry with the aid of programming codes, the site now features content for basic education, also based on programming languages.

Essentially, the website aims to provide tools and tutorials for the use of computational thinking focused on programming logic with the help of programming languages, directly applied to curriculum content through the execution, modification, and creation of codes for the construction and study of interactive objects for technical and scientific topics.


In short… code for content.
