It was designed as a simple, fast, open, playful, reproducible, and shareable alternative for teaching, learning, and research.\nIt promotes literacy and appropriation for scientific expressions involved in natural phenomena, through visualization resulting from parametric manipulation of the simulation. The application is less than 20 kB, can be customized in a text editor, does not require a connection, runs on any operating system, and for both desktops and mobile devices, exports the graph while preserving its interactivity, and allows insertion into web pages.\n\nJSPlotly was designed with the goal of making it as easy as possible to build and share interactive graphs for teaching, learning, and research. Graphs are present in virtually any natural science or mathematics textbook or content, and are one of the most accurate ways to communicate data and natural behaviors. In particular, graphs allow such behavior to be modeled by simulating a phenomenon based on the equation that describes it.\nWith the mathematical function that describes this behavior, it is possible to simulate it based on the parameters and variables that compose it and, just as importantly, observe its behavior when these values are changed. This adds unique value to the technical and scientific content presented by the graph when parametric manipulation is allowed.",

    "text": "1 Mathematics\n\n1.1 Trigonometry (EM13MAT306, EM13MAT308, EM13MAT307)\nThe following simulation aims to facilitate the visualization of some concepts in trigonometry, sine, cosine, and tangent. The code allows you to use a drop-down menu for each trigonometric function, as well as a slider to change the frequency in radians.\n\n\nEquation:\n1. Sine function:\n\\[\ny = \\sin(\\omega x)\n\\]\n2. Cosine function:\n\\[\ny = \\cos(\\omega x)\n\\]\n3. Tangent function:\n\\[\ny = \\tan(\\omega x)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Select the sine, cosine, and tangent functions alternately using the \"drop-down menu\";\n2. Try changing the frequency of the function using the slider;\n3. Overlay a sine graph and a cosine graph to observe their differences;\n4. Repeat the same for the tangent graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Use of selector and buttons in data fluctuation (EF07MA21, EF07GE04, EM13MAT301, EM13CHS104, EM13CNT103)\nA button accesses a specific situation, while a selector allows you to enlarge a specific area of values, highlighting graphical information for a function or significant fluctuations. Both are illustrated below in a simulation for temporal fluctuation of values (expressed as a sine wave modified by random increments).\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Drag the end markers of the graph to view a more restricted limit;\n2. Click on the buttons with different periods;\n2. You can change the random noise around the mathematical equation that defines the fluctuation above by simply modifying the line of code in: \"const values = days.map((_, i) =&gt; 50 + 10 * Math.sin(i / 10) + Math.random() * 50);\" - change ‘50’ to \"5\".\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Simulated animation for a function (EF07MA20, EF09MA20, EM13MAT302, EM13MAT304)\nWith the application, it is possible to simulate a frame-by-frame animation to improve learning of a topic by inserting a manual slider. The following example shows a simulator for manual animation for mathematical functions. To use it, simply slide the slider progressively to see a graphical representation of the result as the predictor variable changes.\nNote:  This educational object has a trick…actually, two! After clicking add, you must first slide the slider to view the graph. And to view an animation for another equation, you must refresh the page, as instructed at the bottom of the graphic screen.\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Slide the control to highlight the manual animation;\n2. Try replacing the model equation with another one, and drag the slider to observe the effect;\n3. Change some parameters for the animation, for example, increasing the \"frames\" levels (slider.max = \"50\"; slider.value = 1);\n4. Reload the page and change the mathematical function; e.g., \"let f = x =&gt; Math.sin(x);\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Simulated animation with multiple sliders\nSimpler and more immediate than code changes, sliders can contribute more immediately to the understanding of a problem, as follows for the example of the parameters of a parabola.\n{target= “_blank”}\n\n1. Drag any slider and observe the trend presented, as well as the change in the equation parameters at the top;\n2. As in the previous example, it is possible to change the mathematical function in the code, as well as the parameters for a new slider. Test this by changing the function \" y_values = x_values.map(x =&gt; a * x * x + b * x + c);\n\" to \" y_values = x_values.map(x =&gt; Math.sin(a * x * x + b * x + c));\"\n\n\n\n1.5 Fractal composition (EM13MAT301, EM13MAT305, EM13MAT401, EM13ARM502, EF09MA10)\nFractals are geometric objects with scale symmetry, forming patterns that repeat in smaller parts of the original object. The most common mathematical representations are Mandelbrot fractals and Julia fractals, which combine art and mathematics in geometric figures with fractional dimensions that express the degree of complexity and space occupation. Originally conceived at IBM in the 1980s, fractals are now seen everywhere from the cartographic outline of certain regions to the distribution of living cells in culture.\n\n\nEquation\nJulia fractals are formed in a complex Cartesian plane by the sum of the real and imaginary components. The basic formula for the Julia set is given by:\n\\[\nz_{n+1}=z_{n}^{2}+c\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nz ∈ C: usually initialized as the point on the complex plane;\nc ∈ C: fixed for each Julia set.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try changing the Real and Imaginary components of the formula to obtain different artistic patterns. Here are some suggestions:\nc = 0 + 0i\nc = -0.4 + 0.6i\nc = 0.285 + 0i\nc = -0.8 + 0.156i\nc = 0.45 + 0.1428i\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6 Mandelbrot Fractal\nAnother interesting structure involves Mandelbrot fractals, represented by a different set of equations. The following example adds this fractal with a selection menu.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Select different colors and magnification levels (\"zoom\") in the two menus for different views;\n2. Check where the equations that define the Mandelbrot profile are located in the code, and make small changes to check different results.",

The statistical distribution curves for this involve the t-Student, F-Snedecor, Chi-square, and normal distribution. The normal distribution curve reflects the statistical behavior for natural phenomena in a given data population.\nThe example aims to illustrate the use of the z-transformation, the calculation of critical values, and the interpretation of the area under the curve in the study of normal distribution and statistical inference.\n\n\nEquation\nThe density function of the normal (or Gaussian) distribution is given below?\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\, e^{ -\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} }\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\mu\\) = 0 (mean of the distribution);\n\\(\\sigma\\) = 1 (standard deviation);\nx = continuous random variable; f = density function of the normal distribution\n\nFrom the above equation, we can extract z, the value of the standardized random variable for zero mean and unit standard deviation, representing the value on the x-axis:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing the value of \"p\" and run the graph. This value represents the probability of observing, under the null hypothesis, a value as extreme or more extreme than the observed value — that is, it measures the evidence against the null hypothesis. In the graph, it represents the area under the normal curve in the critical regions, indicating the chance of the observed result occurring by pure chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Animation of a histogram (EF09MA21, EM13MAT406, EM13MAT407)\nStatistical information is sometimes represented graphically, such as the distribution of values in box-and-whisker plots or histograms. The example below illustrates the potential for understanding a histogram added to an animation feature.\n\n\n! [](Eq/anim_histogr.png)\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Note the various constants at the top of the script that can be changed for a different animation, and try changing them one by one to understand both the action of the object and the statistical content to which it refers:\nconst mu = 0 (mean);\nconst sigma = 1 (standard deviation);\nconst n_frames = 50 (no. of frames);\nconst sample_per_frame = 20 (sample rate/frame);",

Note that, due to the quadratic operation on the deformation value, the potential energy is always positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Motion of bodies (EM13CNT102):\nThe following code illustrates the trajectory of an oblique launch with an angle adjustable by a slider, useful for exploring the concepts of kinematics.\n\n\nEquation:\n1. General equation\n\\[\ny(x) = x \\cdot \\tan(\\theta) - \\frac{g}{2 v_0^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)} \\cdot x^2\n\\]\nWhere:\n\ny(x): height as a function of horizontal distance;\nx: horizontal position (m);\n\\(\\theta\\): angle of launch relative to the horizontal (radians or degrees);\nv0: initial velocity of the projectile (m/s);\ng: acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²\\(^{2}\\))\n\n2. Total flight time:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)} {g}\n\\]\n3. Horizontal position over time\n\\[\nx(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t\n\\]\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Note that there is a slider bar for initial angles in the simulation. Drag the bar to another angle and add the graph, comparing the effect of this modification.\n2. Change the initial velocity in the code and observe the effect on the graph.\n3. Simulate a \" lunar condition\" for the trajectory, whose gravity is around 1/6 that of Earth (~1.6 m/s²).\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Animation for oblique launch (EF09CI09, EF09MA20, EM13CNT103, EM13MAT304)\nLike simulations, animations can aid in understanding a specific topic (simulation- or animation-based learning). JSPlotly can work directly with animations using the Plotly.js library (insertion of frames, buttons, transitions, for example).\nBelow is an animation for the parabolic launch of a projectile, described by the equations in the previous topic. Unlike that one, however, the insertion of an animation adds value to the understanding of the phenomenon by offering the possibility of parametric manipulation of the code associated with the animation itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As in the previous topic, try changing the parameters of the equation, such as the initial velocity and the angle of attack, and observe the effect of these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Animation for translational motion in the solar system - approximate data (EF05CI08, EF07CI01, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT103)\nDynamic representations of complex phenomena can aid in understanding them, regardless of the field of knowledge. In addition, simulations with approximate data from reality can also insert another image into the learner’s cognitive perception. The example below illustrates an animation for the translational motion of the planets in our solar system based on approximate data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Note that there is a slider bar at the top of the object; drag it to observe different speeds for the animation;\n2. Note that the image was made possible by \"zoom\" on the graphic screen, to improve the visualization of the planets. In this sense, try using this feature during the animation; \n2. Note that there are 8 planets in the animation, not including the dwarf planet Pluto. This is not because it has been overlooked, but because you can observe how slow the planets move as they distance themselves from the Sun (see Neptune, which is practically static). In this sense, we can see the potential of an animation with approximate data, providing additional information that is not noticeable in textbooks on the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Animation for simple harmonic motion (EF09CI09, EF09MA18, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT203)\nAmong various situations for analyzing the physical properties of materials and systems, the linear relationship between applied mass and spring deformation is of significant importance. The equation representing the position of the mass as a function of time is given below.\n\n\nEquation\n\\[\nx(t)=Acos(ωt+ϕ)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\nx(t) = The position of the mass at time t;\nA = amplitude of motion, which is the maximum distance of the mass from the equilibrium position (in this case, x=0);\n\\(\\omega\\) = angular frequency, which defines the rate of oscillation. It is calculated by 2\\(\\pi\\)/T, where T is the period (the time for a complete cycle);\n\\(\\phi\\) = initial phase or phase constant, which defines the position of the mass at t=0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing some parameters of the equation of motion, such as amplitude A and angular frequency;\n2. Increase the angular frequency of the animation by reducing the denominator in \"const w\";\n2. Try the \"html\" button and note that the animation is preserved when exporting the file;\n3. Try the \"clone\" button and note that it is possible to share the object in the frozen configuration along with the modified code\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7 Animation for pendulum motion (EF09CI09, EF09MA18, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT203)\nSimilar to the previous object, here we have an animation for the mechanical phenomenon of periodic pendulum motion. The equations describing the position of a simple pendulum as a function of time, using the small oscillations approximation, are given below.\n\n\n\n\nEquation\n\\[\nθ(t)=θ_0​cos(ωt)\n\\]\n\\[\nx(t)=L​sin(θ)\n\\]\n\\[\ny(t)=−L​cos(θ)\n\\]\n\\[\nω=\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\n\\]\nWhere:,\n\nθ(t) = angular position;\nx(t) = x coordinate;\ny(t) = y coordinate;\nω = angular frequency\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As suggested for other objects, try \"parametric exploration\" of the equation involved in the code, changing its parameters;\n2. Note an advantageous feature of simulations over real experiments: the realization of conditions that are impossible in practice. To do this, try the simulation as if you were on the Moon, changing the value of gravitational acceleration to 1.62 m/s^2 (but with \". \", not \",\" - because it is programming syntax.",

Try changing the graph pattern and colors. Respectively: type: ‘surface’, colorscale: ‘Viridis’);\n2. Change the wavelength range, separating the peaks; to do this, change the min/max variables of lambda: const lambdaMin = 450, lambdaMax = 600;\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Heat Capacity (EF09CI06, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT203)\nThe following simulation aims to observe the relationship between heat exchanged (Q), mass (m), heat capacity (c), and temperature variation (\\(\\Delta\\)T).\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nQ = c \\cdot m \\cdot \\Delta T\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1.

Here is an interactive 3D example.\nIn this case, the equation used in the editor involves a smooth variation of temperature over time, using the sine function and an initial temperature (see the code).\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try varying the temperature initially, overlaying some graphs;\n2. Also vary the mass in the code editor for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Animation and reaction kinetics\nA topic that students find difficult to grasp is the abstraction required to uncover the mathematical relationships that arise in chemical reaction kinetics. When dealing with the conversion of reactants into products, for example, there is an inherent barrier to learning about reaction rates, inhibition, and activation. To reduce the impact of this abstraction, here is an example of an animation for reaction kinetics, in which the object changes depending on the reaction rate and modulator options.\n\n\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nR(t)=\\frac {R_0}{1+k_{effective}​t}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(t)=R_0​−R(t)\n\\]\nWhere,\n\n\\(R(t)\\) = amount of reactant R at time \\(t\\) (arbitrary units);\n\\(P(t)\\) = amount of product P at time \\(t\\) (arbitrary units);\n\\(R_{0}\\) = initial amount of reactant at time \\(t=0\\);\n\\(t\\) = time (in seconds);\n\\(k_{\\text{kinetic}}\\) = base rate constant (in \\(s^{-1}\\));\n\\(k_{\\text{effective}}\\) = effective constant after considering catalyst and/or inhibitor:\n\n\\[\nk_{\\text{effective}} \\;=\\;\nk_{\\text{kinetic}} \\times\n\\begin{cases}\nf_{\\text{cat}}, & \\text{if catalyst is on}\\\\[6pt]\n1, & \\text{if catalyst is not bound}\n\\end{cases}\n\\times\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{1}{f_{\\text{inhib}}}, & \\text{if inhibitor is bound}\\\\[6pt]\n1, & \\text{if inhibitor is not bound}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try changing the \"k_cinetica\" constant at the top of the code (e.g., 0.008, 0.017, 0.05) and use Play/Reset to compare;\n2. Try adding/removing inhibitor and catalyst;\n3. Try changing the potential of the modulators above by editing their constants:\na. const catalyzer_factor = 2.0;\n \nb. const inhibition_factor = 3.0; \n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Interactive dashboard for environmental measurements - simulated data (EF07MA21, EF09MA21, EM13MAT406, EM13LGG604)\nCurrently, it is common to present data in a panel containing different interactive information or data that complement each other in graphs and tables, for example. These panels provide an overview of the topic addressed, as well as adjustments to the parameters contained therein. Below is an example of a panel with simulated data for conductivity and temperature measurements in an aqueous medium, with parameters adjustable by a slider (not very practical, in fact, but illustrative of the application’s potential).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Although it is an object that only simulates data acquisition, you can obtain a different result by interfering with the code, such as:\na. Changing the sliders: \"slider.min = \"0\";slider.max = \"24\"; slider.step = ‘1’ \" ;\nb. Changing the equations that define the behavior of the displays:\n\"const time = Array.from ({ length: 25 }, (_, i) =&gt; i); // 0 to 24h\nconst temperature = time.map(t =&gt; 20 + 5 * Math.sin((t - 6) / 3)); // peak 12h\nconst conductivity = time.map(t =&gt; 100 + 30 * Math.cos(t / 5)); \"",

For more robust data, reliable sources are recommended (e.g., MapBiomas Brasil - https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/)\n2. This is a bar chart, nothing more. If you change the information in the constants of the first three vectors (\"const X = [...]\"), you can convert the representation to a different theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Water cycle diagram (EF06CI03, EF06CI04, EM13CNT103, EM13CNT202)\nThe application also allows the creation of other interactive educational objects, without the need to insert equations, such as diagrams and flowcharts. Here are some examples.\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As with the diagrams above, try changing the properties of the arrows and the terms and fields involved in the flowchart in the code;\n2. Replace terms to form another flowchart;\n3. Reposition the objects in the graphic area (fields, terms, arrows) with the help of the mouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Diagram of the light and dark cycles of photosynthesis (EM13CNT101, EM13CNT103, EM13CNT201, EM13MAT405)\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try repositioning the inputs and outputs (e.g., Light, Glucose) by simply dragging them with the mouse;\n2. Replace the terms within the boxes, or change other aspects of the diagram (color, fill, for example).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4 Population Growth Model with Lag Phase (EM13CNT102, EF06MA17, EF08CI06, EM13MAT301, EM13CNT201)\nThis model presents a logistic function that simulates population growth (e.g., microorganisms, cells), accompanied by a delay component. By varying the parameters in the editor, it is possible to estimate different population growth profiles.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nN(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K - N_0}{N_0}\\right) \\cdot e^{-r \\cdot A(t) \\cdot t}}, \\quad \\text{with } A(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(t - t_0)}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nK = environmental carrying capacity;\nN0 = initial population;\nr = intrinsic growth rate;\nA(t) = growth activation factor with delay (lag phase);\nt0 = midpoint of transition between lag phase and log phase;\nk = delay smoothing constant (set to 0.5 in the code)\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try varying the parameters of the equation, combining some of them and comparing their effects on the graphs:\na. Carrying capacity;\nb. Initial population;\nc. Growth rate;\nd. Delay (lag phase);\n\n\n\n\n\n6.5 Energy efficiency and food chain (EF06CI02, EM13CNT202, EM13CNT203)\nHere is an example to illustrate the transfer of energy between different trophic levels of a food chain. Although there is no mathematical function that describes it, the 10% rule of ecological efficiency between the levels of the chain, which results in a logarithmic transfer relationship.\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Lindeman's rule, outlined in the reference above, establishes a variation of 5-20% energy efficiency in the ecosystem. So, try superimposing the curves with these rates;\n2. If you want to observe the logarithmic relationship of energy transfer, add the command \"type: ‘log’,\" just below \"title: ‘Available energy (units)’,\".\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6 Animation for neuron action potential (EF08CI08, EF09CI01, EM13CNT202, EM13CNT302)\nSome natural phenomena are observed over time, although their didactic representation in books and the like is offered in a static manner. In the following example, an animation for neuron potential facilitates learning about depolarization/hyperpolarization/repolarization events that accompany nerve transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing the default values for the potentials presented in \"function potential(i)\" in the code;\n2. Altered values are present in some neurological conditions, such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7 Animation of map of areas burned by biome in Brazil - fictitious data from 1955 to 2024 (EF07CI08, EF08GE08, EM13CHS101, EM13CNT201)\nThe use of maps in Natural Sciences and Human Sciences finds common ground for environmental and socio-economic problems, as illustrated by the following animation. In it, the area in square kilometers burned in each Brazilian biome is shown in the animation with the period and area next to the title of the interactive object, and with a time slider below.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. It is advisable to seek more accurate sources of information on the topics covered, since GSPlotly, as an AI assistant, does not guarantee the nature of the information. In the example, we suggest the \"Queimadas Program - INPE - Terrabrasilis\" (https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/situacao-atual/situacao_atual/);\n2. More accurate data can be entered in the script itself, in the field \"const usar_dados_ficticios = true; // change to false and fill in areaBiomaAno_real()\";\n3. The theme of the animated map can be changed to any other by simply altering the data in the \"General Control\" constants of the script. \n\n\n\n\n\n6.8 Conway’s Game of Life (EF06MA20, EF09MA24, EM13MAT503, EM13CNT201)\nThis object illustrates a version of a cellular automaton conceived in 1970 by J.H. Conway, which simulates biological events such as birth, growth, reproduction, and death through the iterative and partially chaotic distribution of pixels on a screen. The Game provides a mathematical and visual approach to simple rules applied to complex phenomena.\nThe Game allows for four distinct patterns (Glider, Blinker, Toad, Random), each distributing events of birth, survival, and death according to mathematical relationships. You can pause to observe details of the evolution.\n\n\n! [](Eq/lifesgame.png)\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. See at the top of the code that it is possible to change the grid size, time steps, and the probability of a cell being alive in \"Random\" mode.",

The flute was designed for tones (circle) and semitones (semicircles). You can \"play\" the flute by clicking with the left mouse button on a hole or using your finger on a smartphone;\n2. You can add or omit any hole in the flute by simply changing the two lines of the variables \"var naturais\" and \"var sustenidos\";\n2. You can transform your flute into a \"pífano,\" which is generally higher pitched than the recorder and quite common in the northeastern Brazilian tradition. To do this, simply replace the lines of the variables \"var naturais\" and \"var sustenidos,\" changing the value from \"5\" to \"6,\" as follows (add \"add\" next - or ‘clean’/\"add\"):\nvar naturais = [\"C6\",\"D6\",\"E6\",\"F6\",\"G6\",\"A6\",\"B6\"];\nvar sharps = [\"C#6\",\"D#6\",‘F6’,\"F#6\",\"G#6\",\"A#6\",\"B6\"];\n3. Following the above line of reasoning, it is also possible to change the pattern for recorders, bass flutes, and double basses. For example, a German flute (larger hole, soprano, used in schools and represented in the script) or a baroque flute (smaller hole, lower tones).\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3 Piano - with sustain pedal (EF15AR05, EF69AR09, EM13LGG601, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG701)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4 Suggestion\n\n1.

To prolong the sound of the keys, raise the \"sustain\" bar;\n3. As part of JSPlotly, the piano can be shared without the code, only as an instrument for musicalization or training, since it is exported by the \"html\" button, preserving its interactivity and sound by mouse or finger touch on a mobile device;\n4.

However, it can be integrated into an interface for microcontroller boards (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi), exponentially increasing its application for real experimentation and experimental STEAM projects.\nThe example below illustrates an application for real-time acquisition/control via a browser. The setup presents a conductivity data reading in an aqueous solution containing increasing levels of NaCl (0 to 5% w/v). An Arduino Uno R3 board with a Web Serial connection via USB to a notebook running a standalone application for JSPlotly was used. Conductivity was obtained by a commercial TDS (total dissolved solids) sensor with square wave alternating potential (PWM) excitation to minimize polarization effects, and a script adapted from the manufacturer. The TDS sensor operates in the range of 3.3 to 5.0 V (input) with an output of 0 to 2.3 V and a current of 3 to 6 mA.\n\n\n Example of JSPlotly application for interfacing with Arduino. The graph shows conductivity measurements in aqueous medium with a TDS meter for increasing NaCl contents (probe in the left corner). Click on the image to get the standalone JSPlotly application for conductivity.\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor Web Serial connection, you need to install Python on your computer (Windows or Linux) and set up a local server. For Windows, download and install the official file for Python, remembering to click on Add Python to PATH, and type the commands in CMD inside the standalone application folder. Here are the instructions for Linux:\n\n\n\nConnect the Arduino and components (TDS probe, container with water and salt);\n\n\nCopy, paste, and run the manufacturer’s script for TDS in the connected Arduino IDE;\n\n\nClose the Arduino IDE;\n\n\nOpen a Terminal in the standalone application folder of JSPlotly for Arduino (condutiv_JSPlotly.html);\n\n\nType: python3 -m http.server\n\n\nOpen the standalone html of the circuit in Chrome (never in Firefox);\n\n\nThe reading should start in a few moments. If it does not, check that the transfer rate to the Arduino IDE matches that of the application (115200 bauds).\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Since the application is written in JSPlotly, it can be customized for various situations, such as data transfer rate, lines (type, colors, thickness), chart type, among others.",

Positive values indicate a hydrophobic tendency (e.g., Ile, Val, Leu), and negative values indicate a hydrophilic tendency (e.g., Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg).

The following example illustrates its potential for simulating a classic experiment in biochemistry: the characterization of amino acids, peptides, and proteins by chromogenic reactions in test tubes. As the scope of this material is to present and facilitate the use of various OIERs (interactive reproducible teaching objects), users are recommended to search for sources of information related to the reactions briefly described below.\n\nSimulator instructions\nThe simulator allows two options: a) discover the nature of a sample or b) discover the color pattern of reactions for a chosen sample.\n\n\nOption A: discover the nature of a sample:\nHere you can “play” to check whether you are dealing with a protein/peptide (chain) sample, an amino acid (AA) sample, a specific mixture of AAs, or AA(s) present in a chain. To do this:\n\nClick on the image below and select “add.” A set of seven colored bars will be generated, representing the colors obtained in test tubes for seven different reactions for protein characterization: ninhydrin, biuret, Pauly, xanthoprotein, Sakagushi, Millon, and sulfur (Cys).\nDiscover the type of sample based on the color pattern of the tubes presented, providing a guess.

    "text": "20 Cyclic voltammetry\n\nContext:\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) is an electroanalytical technique for characterizing interfacial (electrode-solution) redox processes. When a standard analyte in quantitative equilibrium between the oxidized and reduced forms is used, the resulting graph acquires an unusual profile, called a duck shape. This results from the peculiar shape obtained from a bidirectional potentiometric scan over a set of electrodes by a potentiostat, resulting in cycles of oxidation and subsequent reduction (application of positive potentials followed by negative potentials). The shape, value, and distance between the resulting peaks allow the analyte to be identified and characterized, as well as the redox processes involved in the experiment.\n\n\nEquation:\nAlthough the formalism for cyclic voltammetry is complex and involves solving ordinary differential equations (as well as electroanalytical techniques in general), which is beyond the scope of this material, the resulting current flow can be summarized by the following Buttler-Volmer equation:\n\\[\nj = j_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F (E - E^0)}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(1 - \\alpha) n F (E - E^0)}{RT}\\right) \\right]\n\\] Where:\n\nj = current density;\nj\\(_{0}\\) = exchange current;\n\\(\\alpha\\) = charge transfer coefficient;\nE = potential applied to the electrode;\nE\\(^{0}\\) = standard electrode potential;\nn = number of electrons;\nF = Faraday constant (96485 C·mol⁻¹)\nR = universal gas constant (8.314 J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹);\nT = temperature\n\n\nFor a model of electroanalyte diffusion and accumulation at the electrode surface, the general equation for the boundary condition where the redox conversion rate is proportional to the diffusion current can be represented by Fick’s 2nd Law equation  for mass transport:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial C(x,t)} {\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C(x,t)} {\\partial x^2}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nC(x,t) = concentration of the electroanalytical species (mol/cm³), as a function of position x and time t;\nD = diffusion coefficient of the species (cm²/s);\nt = time (s);\nx = distance from the electrode surface (cm);\n\\(\\delta\\) = notation for partial derivative.\n\n\nThe chemical equilibrium of the redox reaction is given by the ratio between the concentrations of the oxidized and reduced forms at the electrode/solution interface when the system is in equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium), according to the Nernst equation:\n$$\nE = E^0 + ( ) $$\nThe resulting current is obtained by Faraday’s law:\n\\[\ni(t) = n F A D \\left. \\frac{\\partial C(x,t)} {\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0}\n\\] Where:\n\nA = electrode surface area (cm²);\ni(t) = current at time t (A, Ampere).\n\n\n\nCyclic Voltametry Simulator\nTo illustrate the potential of the JSPlotly/GSPlotly platform for developing complex virtual experiments, here is a cyclic voltametry simulator resulting from the above procedures (as well as a few hours of prompt engineering!!).\nThe example illustrates typical behavior in cyclic voltammetry (and the curious duck shape), and includes a model of diffusion and accumulation of electroactive species near the electrode surface. The code uses a numerical solution to obtain the current density over time, considering the effects of cyclic scanning of the applied potential, mass transport, and reaction kinetics.\nIn short, it numerically solves Fick’s equation with dynamic boundary conditions, applies the Nernst equation at the boundary (electrode surface) to determine the conversion between species, uses the finite difference method or explicit scheme to advance in time, and obtains the current by applying Faraday’s Law, by the derivative of the flux at the interface.\nDid you find it complex? Then how about this: the code combines Fick (transport) and Nernst (local redox equilibrium) to accurately model the shape of the voltammogram, obtaining a physical simulation with significant realism for cyclic voltammetry.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Observe the number of values at the beginning of the code, tangible to \"parametric manipulation.\" Try to understand what they represent, and consciously vary their values, aiming to add value to the learning of the simulation. This is the essence of \"parametric manipulation\" that involves \"reproducible teaching\"!",

Models can be linear or nonlinear. When nonlinear, they can be applied empirically to the data (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, or power functions), or from a mathematical function that explains the model.\nIn this case, techniques for nonlinear adjustment of the data to the model are used, such as Simplex, Gauss, Newton-Raphson, Levenberg-Marquardt, or least squares, for example. Whatever the method, nonlinear adjustment differs from linear adjustment in its assumptions and treatment of data (see a quick explanation here.\n\nContext: Ligand-protein interaction (grid search algorithm)\nThe following example illustrates the application of a nonlinear adjustment of molecular interaction data using the Langmuir model and treatment by quadratic error minimization by manual scanning. In this treatment, the sum of quadratic errors (RMSE) is calculated for combinations of a and b, selecting the pair with the lowest calculated error. In this case, for simplicity, although JSPlotly works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but carried out by grid search, and not by classical iterative methods. Thus, a set of values is tested for the pair (a, b) in a previously defined grid (table of combinations), allowing the identification of the parameters that best describe the experimental data according to the minimum error criterion.\n\n\n\n\nEquation:\nThe Langmuir equation is represented below:\n\\[\nY = \\frac{aX}{K_d + X}\n\\] Where:\n\nY = fraction of occupied sites;\nX = concentration of free ligand;\na = saturation value (sites of the same affinity completely occupied);\nKd = equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex.\n\nIn this case, the nonlinear least squares function is:\n\\[\nSSR(a, K_d) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{a x_i}{K_d + x_i} \\right)^2\n\\]\nWhere:\nSSR = sum of the squares of the residuals (inversely proportional to the quality of the fit)\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As in the previous example, alternately display the points and the adjustment curve using the \"Boolean\" operation (\"showPoints = true/false\"; \"showCurve = true/false\");\n2. Change the data and perform a new fit to obtain other parameters of the equation (Kd, SSR, R², adjusted R²). Note: Adjusted R² corresponds to the value of R² corrected for the number of model parameters (in this case, \"2\"), directly affecting the \"degrees of freedom\" for the fit.\n\n\n\n\n\nContext - Competitive inhibition in enzyme kinetics (Gauss-Newton algorithm)\nThe Gauss-Newton method iteratively adjusts nonlinear models to experimental data sets. It is especially efficient when the model is quasi-linear with respect to the parameters and the residuals are moderately small. The goal is to find the parameters \\(\\theta\\) that minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals between the observed data yi and the values predicted by the model f(xi,\\(\\theta\\). Unlike the full Newton-Raphson method, Gauss-Newton avoids the explicit calculation of the Hessian by using an approximation based on the Jacobian of the residuals.",

    "text": "Equation:\nThis approximation results in a linear system that can be solved at each iteration to update the model parameters. The central formula of the method consists of multiplying the transposed Jacobian JT by the Jacobian J itself, forming a symmetric matrix that approximates the Hessian. The residual vector r is then used to determine the update direction \\(\\Delta\\theta\\), with the following equation:\n\\[\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k + \\left(J^T J\\right)^{-1} J^T \\cdot r\n\\]\nTo illustrate the potential of the application in iterative nonlinear fitting, here is an example for enzyme kinetics using a competitive inhibition model.\nThe code allows you to adjust the seeds, tolerance, and number of iterations, and provides the graph (points/adjusted line, manually), and statistical parameters of the regression.\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nNote that the code has a flag for true/false in the fit constant.

It is yet another of the many applications for simulating a whiteboard or digital chalkboard/pen. However, it differs from its competitors in the following ways:\n\nIt can be exported as a self-sufficient HTML file using a button on the whiteboard itself, allowing the generated image to be shared and edited further.\nIt allows customization of the code that produces it, allowing you to insert/change pens, thicknesses, and different actions not provided for in the source code.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to its features, the digital whiteboard allows you to:\n\nWrite with 7 colors and 3 different thicknesses;\nAccess 4 different colored backgrounds;\nOverlay the plane with a grid;\nUse an eraser;\nUse a laser pointer to locate what you want to highlight;\nSave the image as a PNG, indicating the date and time;\nUndo and clean commands for the board;\nKeyboard shortcuts: E=eraser; L=laser; Z undo, X clean, H save HTML\n\n\n31.1 Suggestion:\n\n1. You can change the thickness of the pens in \"var baseWidth = 1;\" ;\n2. The 1x, 2x, 4x buttons are multipliers; edit the button creation lines to change the label/multiplier (e.g., \"addSize(‘3x’, 3, true)\").",
