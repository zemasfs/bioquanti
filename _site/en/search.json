Let’s take a look at the main window of Rstudio.\n\n\n\nBasic RStudio window. A - command input area (prompt); B - work tab area (directory, graphs, packages, etc.); C - files that appear in the tab of the same name; D - administration tab area (environment, command history, etc.).\n\n\nFor our work, however, an additional area will be useful, the script area, which can be accessed as follows:\n\nFile --&gt; New File --&gt; RScript...\n\n or by shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + N\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the main window has now been divided into two parts, including the new tab for scripts."

    "text": "5 Some recommendations for typing in an R script:\nThere are some basic assumptions for an R script to be read clearly by its developer, as well as compiled correctly by the program:\n\nTyping: whenever there is an error in the script in Rstudio, a red cross will appear on the left side of the command line; once the error is corrected, the sign disappears;\nComments: so that the script can also be read by a human being, it is advisable to add comments to the command lines (starting with #) - one of the basics of Reproducible Teaching;\nIndentation: allow “indentation” when the line is a little long by clicking the Enter key after a separation of arguments by “comma”. This way, the line continues just below, but with a small shift to the right. This makes the code easier to read.\nNames: R commands are in English. Therefore, you should avoid using variables and file names with accents or graphic symbols in Portuguese (e.g., ç, ~). In addition, R is a code compiler. If you define a compound name for a file or variable, i.e., with a space between the terms (as is normal in everyday language, e.g., my file), R will try to execute the terms separately (e.g., “my” and then “file”), which will cause the reading to be interrupted and an error message to appear. Therefore, for variable and file names, give preference to one of the three types of common conventions used in programming, namely:\n\n\nseparation by underline, ” _ “ or hyphen; e.g.: my_variable, my-variable\nseparation by capital letters; e.g.: myVariable\nseparation by dots; e.g.: my.variable"

And many others that your imagination and technical rigor allow you to study.\nIn these cases, it is interesting to know and apply a few animation commands explained below. The examples have been selected to simplify each command. But don’t be fooled by the capabilities of Jmol, because for each command there are always several complementary options. And if you want to know anything about any Jmol command, visit the reference website.\n\n1.1 Spin\nSimple command to rotate the molecule.\n\nload $glucose; spin 30 # the value refers to the rotation speed\n\n\n\n1.2 ZoomTo (resize)\nThis command is impressive because it allows for controlled magnification or reduction over time. Its syntax is:\n\n*zoomTo* : time (optional expression) size\n\nExamples:\n\nIncrease by 3x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 *3 \n\nIncrease by 4x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 400\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand with 2x magnification: zoomto 2(ligand) 0\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand with 4x magnification, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5(ligand)* 4\n\n\n\n1.3 Delay\nThis is a key command for any animation, as it allows the image of the molecule in Jmol to pause (in seconds) before the next action. It is normally used in the sequence of commands by the Console throughout a script.\n\ndelay 3 # waits 3 seconds before the next action\n\nWe can try out an animation with the above commands using the cyclohexanol model.\n\n\n\nCyclohexanol structure. Source: MAPA: high school - 2nd semester, 3rd year, p.57. Natural sciences and their technologies.\n\n\nHere is a code snippet for you to try out animations with Jmol. Just copy and paste it into the Console and run it. If you prefer to make any changes, it is best to copy it to a notepad, modify it, and test the script in the Console.\n\nNow it’s up to you:\nload $cyclohexanol\ndelay 2\nspin Y 70\ndelay 2\nspin off\nzoomTo 2 *2\ncpk\ndelay 2\ncolor transparent\nzoomTo 2 *0.5\nspin 50"

Thus, Jmol can render the model as stick, wireframe, filled space, ball and stick, trace, and cartoon (all in English, of course - cpk, wireframe, trace, cartoon).\nTry these styles, including the only option. This option allows the action not to be superimposed on previous ones (in this case, the superimposition of representations). To do this, copy, paste, and execute on each separate line the code snippet that follows in the Jmol Console, whose rendering illustrates the fluoxetine molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\nload $fluoxetine # loads the molecule\nwireframe only # wireframe style\ncpk only # filled space\ncpk 20 only, bond 1 # balls and sticks\ncartoon only # cartoon representation, but this does not occur with small molecules, only with biomacromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, for example)\n\nNote also that the cartoon representation does not result in a rendering for the fluoxetine model. This is because the cartoon representation is restricted to biopolymers only, i.e., proteins and nucleic acids, and some supramolecular associations.\nHowever, if you want to try cartoon, you will need to know the alphanumeric code for a protein or nucleic acid. For example, for myoglobin, an oxygen-carrying protein in mammals (code: 1mcy)\n\nload=1mcy # loading myoglobin\n\n# Note: note that the command line for biopolymers is slightly different from that used for small molecules\n\nNote that the default rendering for large molecules is balls and sticks, which is not very educational for learners. In this case, it can be represented as a unique drawing by typing:\n\ncartoon only # rendering as a drawing\n\nTo obtain this and other protein and nucleic acid codes, enter the PDB - Protein Data Bank, RCSB database and type the name in the search field (in this case, myoglobin). The system returns several structural models and their codes. Simply transcribe one of these codes to the JSmol Console.\nIf you would like to learn more about biomolecules and the use of Jmol, I invite you to visit the Biochemistry portal."

For example, in text editors, it is common to click on a formatting icon (italics, bold, etc.) or even type its shortcut to complete what you want in the text.\nSimple, practical, and fast. In the same way, you can use Jmol, both in the version downloaded to your computer and in the online version. For the downloaded version, just look at the range of menu items and submenus. For the browser version, note that there is no menu!\nHowever, the online version allows you to view the same information, albeit with a different formatting, by simply right-clicking anywhere on the screen (a fancy name for the screen containing some information, the molecule, in this case)."

Suppose you want to make a simple graph, taking two columns, each for a variable (independent or x, and dependent, or y). The usual thing would be to click on a menu item for graphs, select the desired columns in specific fields of the window that opens, select the type of graph, click on next or a similar term, select other characteristics (labels or names on the x and y axes, for example), and finally click on finish (or OK, or a term with a similar meaning). Simple, fast, and practical.\nBut (there’s always a “but”)…what if, in addition to constructing the graph, you needed to perform additional actions, such as obtaining the linear fit of the data, displaying the resulting line with a specific color and style, inserting the line equation at a specific point on the graph, adding a title, and changing the symbol of the points, including the type, size, and color. Phew!!!\nNo problem, either… as long as you have a good tutorial at hand, of course! Or that you are already familiar with the spreadsheet program, menus, and actions relevant to the various mouse clicks that will be necessary to obtain a nice linear regression graph at the end.\nNow… one more small variable to add to the example above: suppose that you are not the one constructing the graph, but a student in your class, and that they have not been trained in the use of the spreadsheet or in the intended calculations!\nNotice that now there will be some discomfort, since:\n\nThe student has no prior knowledge of how to use the spreadsheet;\nThe student has no prior knowledge of the intended calculations;\nYou will have to train the student or provide them with a related training guide;\nIf training has already taken place but the guide is not available, both you and the student will depend on your memory retention to successfully complete the task.\n\nNow, what if the instructions for executing the final product were not in a guide for repeating mouse clicks, but rather in a short text containing both the commands in sequence and explanatory comments for each individual action, and that when inserted into the program, it generated the graph already fully formatted, colored, and with the linear adjustment and result parameters?"

Separating commands by lines - e.g.,\n\"cpk only\ncolor blue\"\n\nIf you want the model to perform a few commands, the best option is to separate them with semicolons (“;”).

This way, the line continues just below, but with a small shift to the right. This makes the code easier to read.\nNames: R commands are in English. Therefore, you should avoid using variables and file names with accents or graphic symbols in Portuguese (e.g. ç, ~). Furthermore, R is a code compiler. If you define a compound name for a file or variable, that is, with a space between the terms (as is normal in everyday life, e.g. my file), R will try to execute the terms separately (e.g. “my”, and then “file”), which will interrupt the reading and give you an error message. Therefore, for variable and file names, give preference to one of the 3 types of common conventions used in programming, namely:\n\n\nseparation by underscore, ” _ “ or hyphen; e.g. my_variable, my-variable\nseparation by capital letters; e.g. myVariable\nseparation by periods; e.g. my.Variable"

    "text": "Building interactive graphics with plotly\n\nObjectives:\n1. Understand what “plotly” is for and its interactive potential for teaching and learning\n2. Use “plotly” through scripts to build interactive graphics\n3. Check the interactivity of the created graphics\n\n\nThe plotly library is one of the richest in R for interactive graphics. It allows, among other things, zoom effects on the graph, as well as mouse over, in which simply passing the mouse over an element of the graph opens the information for that point. In addition, it allows user-controlled animations, the insertion of selectors, sliders, menus and buttons.\n\n\nIn addition, because it allows integration with a language of these times called JavaScript, the library is also used in some data panels, such as in Power Bi from Microsoft, a collection of connected applications for data visualization. In fact, it is the plotlyjs library itself written in JavaScript, external to R and RStudio, that is incorporated into R.\nCreating graphs with plotly requires a few simple commands. And the good news is that the graph produced already “comes out” with interactivity, such as enlargement/reduction, data displacement on axes, and information effects when passing the mouse, saving as a PNG image, among others. To build any graph you need data. Basically, there are 3 ways to obtain the data:\n\n* Creating the data;\n* Creating an equation that will generate the data;\n* Importing the data (from a spreadsheet, for example)\n\n\n## Creating an interactive graph\nLet’s start by creating the data from an equation applied to a vector. To do this, we need…the vector! Visualize a vector as if it were an Excel column (or row). In R, vectors are created by concatenating values ​​separated by commas, as follows:\n\nx = c(1,2,3,4,5) # a vector; the \"c\" indicates \"concatenation\"\n# assigns values ​​from 1 to 5 to the variable \"x\"\n\n# Alternatively,\n\nx = 1:5 # also assigns values ​​from 1 to 5 to the variable \"x\"\n\nTo create the interactive graph, let’s illustrate the vertical launch equation below.\n\n\nNow we will create an interactive graph from this data. But first, of course, you need to install the plotly package in R. You can install it from the Packages tab of RStudio, if you haven’t already done so, and as explained in the previous section on Packages.\n\n\nFinal step… build a scatter plot of the vertical ascent function.\nTo do this, simply copy the snippet below and paste it into a new R script. And run it in any of the ways mentioned in the previous section.\n\n\n\n# Data:\nt = 1:20 # define the time vector\nVo = 100 # initial velocity, 100 m/s\ng = 9.8 # acceleration of gravity, m/s^2\n\n# Equation (vertical ascent):\n\nH = Vo*t-1/2*g*t^2\n\n# Interactive graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = ~t, y = ~H)\n\n\n\n\n# Note:\n# Plotly syntax: ~variable, to assign a variable (x or y)\n# type: to assign a graph type\n\nR usually displays some messages (Warnings) after running the commands. They are not errors, but additional information, such as when reproducing the previous graph. In this case, the information that is missing is to characterize the type of graph, a scatter plot (scatter):\n\nplot_ly(x = t, y = H, type = 'scatter')\n\nNow observe how much interactivity arose with the simple command above, passing the mouse over the points on the graph, or clicking on the icons that appeared above the graph. Test this interactivity:\n\nPassing the mouse over the points on the graph (hover) you will obtain the coordinates of each point;\nUsing the mouse scroll button you will enlarge or reduce the graph\nClicking with the left mouse button on any part of the graph and drawing a rectangle you will obtain an enlargement of the area;\nIf you double-click after enlarging you will return to the original graph;\nBy positioning the mouse pointer between the values ​​of an axis and dragging the mouse, you will see a shift of the selected axis;\nBy selecting an icon in the upper right corner of the graph, you can, in sequence from the left, download the plot as an image, perform an enlargement, shift the axes, select the points inside a box or inside a loop, enlarge, reduce, scale to the original size, realign the axes to those of the original plot, observe the coordinates (x and y), observe only the y coordinate, and return to the beginning."

Source: MAPA: high school - Natural sciences and their technologies. 2nd Bim. 3rd Year, p.28.\n\n\nFor example, if you are working on a spreadsheet (e.g.: Excel) and want to construct a graph of the above relationship, say V versus p, you will have to create a column with this operation. In plotly, as well as in R as a whole, this is not necessary, since p can be considered as 1/V constant. In fact, this constant is represented by the general constant of ideal gases, R, of known value.\nSolving for the situation above:\n\n# Data:\nR = 8.314 # J/(mol*K), general constant of ideal gases\nV = seq(0,22.4, length.out=50) # vector of \"Volume\" (in liters), with 50 points\nT = 298 # K, absolute temperature\n\n# Equation\n# pV = RT; p = RT/V\np = R*T/V\n\n# Graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = V, y = ~R*T/V, type = 'scatter', mode='lines')\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you want to name the axis labels and provide a title to the graph to better present the physical meaning of the quantities involved, simply add the layout command, as follows:\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(magrittr) # library for the pipe operator \"%&gt;%\"\nplot_ly(x = V, y = ~R*T/V, type = 'scatter', mode='lines') %&gt;%\nlayout(\ntitle = \"Isothermal Transformation of a Gas\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"Volume V, L\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"Pressure p, bar\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s up to you:\nOpen a new script and build a graph that presents any relationship between variables, as suggested below:\n\nCreate the values of the independent variable (ex: x = 1:10);\n\nLoad the plotly library - library(plotly) ;\n\nType a general command line for the graph:\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~sqrt(x), type = \"scatter\")\n\nSelect these lines, press Ctrl+Enter, and observe the output (i.e., the graph, in the plots tab;\n\nModify the variable “y”, replacing the value of “x” with some other relation, such as: ~exp(x) - exponential, ~sin(10*x) - sine, ~sqrt(x)` - square root;\n\n\n\n\n## Other types of graphs\nIt is also possible to create other graphs, such as lines, bars, histograms, or box-plots (“box and whiskers”). Some of these possibilities are illustrated below.\n\n\n\nSome types of graphs presented in the Support Manual. Source: MAPA: high school - Mathematics and its technologies. 2nd Bim. 3rd Year, p.9, 10, 22, and 23.\n\n\nIn plotly there is a range of possible graphs. Try some types:\n\n# Lines\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~x, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Bars\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nclasses &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") # data for the bar graph\npercentages &lt;- c(25, 35, 20, 20)\n\nplot_ly(x = ~classes, y = ~percentages, type = 'bar')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nclasses &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") # data for the bar chart\npercentages &lt;- c(25, 35, 20, 20)\n\n# Pie chart\nplot_ly(labels = classes, values = percentages, type = 'pie')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Histogram\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nx &lt;- rnorm(1000) # command to generate random data in `R`\nplot_ly(x = ~x, type = \"histogram\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Boxplot\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nx &lt;- rnorm(50) # generate random data\ny &lt;- rnorm(50, mean = 1) # generate statistical variation in the data\n\nplot_ly(y = ~x, type = \"box\", name = 'Group 1') %&gt;% # add the two boxes for the data\nadd_trace(y = ~y, type = \"box\", name = 'Group 2')\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to combine some types, such as a points and lines plot:\n\n# Points and lines\nlibrary(plotly)\nx &lt;- 1:10\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~x^2, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers, lines') # also works if 'markers+lines'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 3D plots\nTo end this part, three-dimensional plots! The basic version of a 3D plot is very simple to execute in plotly, and its visual and interactive effect are very expressive!\nAn example of a 3D plot can be obtained from the relations of radius, surface area, and volume of a sphere, as follows.\n\n\n\nMathematical relations of surface area and volume of a sphere in function of its radius. Source: MAPA: high school - Mathematics and its technologies. 1st Bim. 3rd Year, p.15.\n\n\nNow let’s create the interactive 3D graph in plotly. The simplest would be with the labels with the standard names, x, y and z. But it is better to add the layout command to give physical meaning and improve the interpretation of the graph.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Data:\nr = seq(0,100, length.out = 50)\nAreaSup = 4*pi*r^2 # calculation of the surface area of ​​the sphere\nVolume = 4/3*pi*r^3 # calculation of the volume of the sphere\n\n# Graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = r, y = AreaSup, z = Volume,\nmode= 'markers+lines')%&gt;%\nlayout(scene = list(\nxaxis=list(title=\"radius\"),\nyaxis=list(title=\"surface area\"),\nzaxis=list(title=\"volume\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the graph is also interactive about other aspects, such as its rotation on any of the 3 axes. From a content point of view, this graph illustrates how the values of surface area, and even more so of volume, vary enormously depending on the radius of a sphere. This also partly explains the great success of the use of nanoparticles in Science and Technology today (high surface area in a reduced size).\nAnother interesting three-dimensional graph is that of 3D surface. Like the one above, few lines are needed to define it. The difference is that you can work with an equation, for the surface, see:\n\nx &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 50)\ny &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 50)\nz &lt;- outer(x, y, function(x, y) x^2 - y^2) # equation x^2+y^2\n\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, type = 'surface') %&gt;%\nlayout(title = \"Surface Plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other types of graphs for plotly, so it is worth visiting the website for more information."

The slider control can be useful when you want to focus on a certain region of the graph. For example, adjusting the CO\\(_{2}\\) emissions for the last few years.\n\nAdding a dropdown menu\nDropdown menus allow you to see a different graph for each option selected. To illustrate this interactive feature, let’s first create a data set (dataframe) that contains the linear, quadratic, and cubic responses to an independent variable, as follows:\n\nx = 1:10 # vector of the independent variable \"x\"\nyLin = x\nyQuad = x^2 # creation of the quadratic dependent variable\nyCub = x^3 # creation of the cubic dependent variable\n\ndatLQC &lt;-data.frame(x,yLin,yQuad,yCub) # creation of the data sheet\n\nNow we can insert the dropdown for the mathematical trends option:\n\nplot_ly(datLQC, x = ~x, y = ~yLin, type = \"scatter\", mode = \"line\", name = \"Linear\") %&gt;%\nadd_trace(x = ~x, y = ~yQuad, mode = \"line\", name = \"Quadratic\") %&gt;%\nadd_trace(x = ~x, y = ~yCub, mode = \"line\", name = \"Cubic\") %&gt;%\nlayout(\ntitle = \"Power Plots\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"x\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"x^n\"),\nupdatemenus = list(\nlist(\nbuttons = list(\nlist(label = \"yLin\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)))),\n list(label = \"yQuad\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)))),\n list(label = \"yCub\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))))\n ) \n)\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though you may find the code snippet above a bit complicated, just copy it, paste it into a script, and run it. This exemplifies the essence inherent in Reproducible Teaching, from the simple reproduction of the code, to its modification and even the creation of new ones. Feeling curious, you can change some terms in the code above, such as the labels (label, replace a name, for example) that appear in the drop-down menu, the type of graph intended (replace scatter with bar, for example), or the title of the graph (title).\n\n\nRegarding the interactivity produced, it is added to that which was already present by the plot_ly command, the selection of the type of power to be represented by the drop-down menu.\n\n\nAs with many R packages, there are a significant number of commands and interactive widgets with plotly, which, in this specific case, would be enough to cover a separate literary work. However, you can consult numerous websites about plotly for a more comprehensive learning, the links below, and even a free online book with related codes and graphs.

This is called multivariate data. To illustrate this situation, let’s say you want to offer varied information in a graph that involves the relationship between a country’s gross domestic product and the life expectancy of its inhabitants over time. \\\n\n\n\nSome economic indexes associated with life expectancy in 2001. Source: MAPA: high school - Humanities and their technologies. 1st Bim. 2nd Year, p.101.\n\n\nTo illustrate the interactive richness that can be obtained by plotly about the influence of the gross domestic product - GDP on life expectancy, we can import a data set from the internet and create a graph about this relationship, see:\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Obtaining the data from the internet\nurl &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpida &lt;- url # assigning the data to an `R` object\n\n# Creating the interactive graph\nplot_ly(\ndadosExpida, # data converted from the internet\nx = ~gdpPercap, # name of the per capita income column in the data\ny = ~lifeExp, # name of the life expectancy column in the data\ntype = 'scatter', # type of graph (scatter)\nmode = 'markers' # type of scatter (points)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! Simple, direct, and interactive code. If you move the mouse over the points you will see the GDP and life expectancy coordinates. However, it is not possible to know from this graph who is who, that is, which country has which GDP, as well as other information that is contained in the original spreadsheet downloaded from the internet. To give you an idea, this spreadsheet contains, in addition to the GDP and life expectancy values, the country and its population, the continent to which it belongs, as well as the year in which the data was measured.\n\n\nThus, we are faced with a multivariate data table, very common in various databases, such as IBGE or DATASUS.\n\n\nWhat if we could present everything at once, that is, GDP, life expectancy, the country, the population size, the country, the continent, and the year of measurement of all this, that is, six variables, between numeric and categorical (classes)?!\n\n\nImpossible?! Don’t stop R!! Here is a code snippet for this, and with the proposed result. Don’t worry about the size or details. If you want to reproduce this code, you know what to do… just copy, paste, and run the code in an R script. \\\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Getting the data from the internet\nurl &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpida &lt;- url # assigning the data to an `R` object\n\n# Creating the interactive graph with animation\nplot_ly(\ndadosExpida, # data converted from the internet\nx = ~gdpPercap, # per capita income\ny = ~lifeExp, # life expectancy\nsize = ~pop, # size of the points as a function of the population\ncolor = ~country, # color of the points as a function of the country\nframe = ~year, # Frame for the animation by year of data collection\ntext = ~continent, # Country as information when hovering the mouse\nhoverinfo = \"text\",\ntype = 'scatter', # type of graph\nmode = 'markers',\nmarker = list(sizemode = 'diameter', opacity = 0.7)\n) %&gt;%\nlayout( # assigning title and axis labels\ntitle = \"Gross Domestic Product X Life Expectancy\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"GDP (log), US$\", type = \"log\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"Life Expectancy, years\"),\nshowlegend = TRUE # whether or not to display the legend\n) %&gt;%\nanimation_opts(\nframe = 1000, # Animation speed\ntransition = 0,\nredraw = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo go to the “playground” now, press PLAY and observe the temporal transition of life expectancy as a function of the countries’ GDP. And notice that all the other data is there, separated by point size (population), color (country), continent (hover, mouse over), and year (animation frame or frame)!\n\n\nOne more detail! If you look at the legend, you’ll see that it also slides, identifying each country by a color. Want to know where Brazil is in this crazy graph’s relationship between GDP and life expectancy? Easy. Find Brazil in the legend, double-click, and notice that now only that point is highlighted."

Since it is a map, the information is obtained in specific geographic coordinates.

Note that the map starts in South America, a condition inserted in the code to make it easier to search for cities. Try placing a comment (#) to the left of the “scope = …“ section, and the information will come from the world map.* Now notice that when you move the mouse over the cities, the proposed geographic coordinates are identified.\n\n\n\nNow it’s up to you:\n\nFind the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of your hometown, or that of a loved one. To do this, search the internet;\nCopy the code above, and paste it into a new script;\nReplace the attributes “name”, “lat”, and “lon” in the data.frame of the code you searched for.\nRun the script and observe the chosen municipality on the interactive map. Tip: if you selected a city outside of South America, put a “#” before the “scope = …“ line."

Note that there is a sidebar showing the legend about the quantity of production, in Also note that the “type” of the graph is now choroplet (and not scattergeo). In its simplest version, it only needs the standardized names of the countries. But it can also be done with a database that only has the geographic coordinates of latitude and longitude.\nTo help in this direction, here are two practical links to geographic coordinate files, accessible by R:\n\nCoordinates of Brazilian municipalities\nCoordinates of world capitals\n\nAnd in this case, any database in this regard will be welcome. Which means in practice being able to exemplify any information of didactic content interactively on a map (e.g.: production/export of inputs, clinical observations, historical landmarks, etc.)."

    "text": "1 How to load a molecule into JSmol\nJSmol is nothing more than Jmol itself, only developed for use in an internet browser, and which uses JavaScript among its languages (hence the S in JSmol).\nAssuming that you have already opened the window for the JSmol applet in your browser but, contrary to what was done before (molecule name at the end of the site PubChem), you want to:\n\nload a molecule from another database;\nload a molecule whose file is already on your computer\n\nWell, in that case you can use the mouse or a command line, whichever you prefer.\n\n1.1 Loading the molecule with the mouse\nTo do this, simply right-click on the screen, as before, and select File–&gt;Load. The options that appear are:\n\n* Open local file # opens a window to search for the model file on your computer;\n* Open URL # opens a window to search for the internet address that has the file\n* Get PDB file # opens a window to enter a macromolecule code from the website of the same name (mainly proteins and nucleic acids)\n* Get MOL file # opens a window to search for a *.mol file\n* Open script # opens a window to search for a piece of code on the computer\n\nThe first option is self-explanatory (Open local file), the second option (Open URL) depends on the correct address for a given molecular model, the third (Get PDB file) refers to the Protein Data Brookhaven database for biopolymers, the fourth (Get MOL file) involves searching online in a specific database for small molecules, and the last (Open script), searching for a file containing lines of Jmol code for a set of actions.\nAs textbooks cover small molecular structures, usually associated with functional groups in Inorganic and Organic Chemistry, as well as specific examples in areas such as Health, Biotechnology, and Industry, including some macromolecule models, it can be concluded that you are more likely to use remote search for small molecules (Get MOL file), molecules contained on your computer (Open local file), and/or biomacromolecules (Get PDB file).\nLoading small molecules is identical to what was tried by adding the model name to the end of the JSmol address. Remote loading for protein, enzyme, and nucleic acid models requires knowledge of their PDB code or a keyword search on the Protein Data Brookhaven website.\nLoading molecules saved on your PC involves a few steps, namely:\n\nObtain the molecule model from the internet, or build it yourself;\nDownload the file corresponding to the model (usually with an attribute *.mol, *.cif, *.cml, *.sdf, among more than 60 formats);\nLoad it onto the JSmol page in one of two ways:\n\n\n1. By clicking: File --&gt; Load --&gt; Open local file ;\n2. By dragging the file from the folder where it is located to the JSmol tab in the browser.\n\n\nFor example, let’s say you want to view the structure of aspirin downloaded to your computer.\n\nNow it’s up to you:\n\nGo to the Pubchem website: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nType aspirin in the field and click on the 3D image that appears;\nDownload the model by clicking on Download Coordinates, and then on the SDF option;\nClick on the first link to open the information about aspirin Download the structural model of aspirin from PubChem;\nOpen the JSmol Console in your browser (right-click on the screen and select “Console”);\nAlternatively:\n\n\nLocate the file on your PC by going to “File–&gt;Load–&gt;Open local file,” then click “Load” to load it;\nClick on the downloaded file (“aspirin.sdf”, for example) and drag it directly into the JSmol window.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Loading the molecule via command line\nLoading a particular model via command line is restricted to searching for it on the internet, in databases, or on web pages. To do this, open the Console as explained above. The upper part is used to display the results of the commands, and the lower part is used to type them. In this case, click on the lower box of the Console and type the loading command, shown here as an example for an alkane:\n\nload $alkane\n\nThe Jmol Console, although it is a command programming language in its own right, has an interesting advantage over other programming languages: commands can be entered in the Console using either upper or lower case letters, and in both singular and plural forms.\nYou can try with other molecules, such as aspirin, cholesterol, phenol, etc. (names in English, due to the database). To retrieve a command line that was written previously, simply navigate between the commands that were used with the up and down arrows on the keyboard (command history).\nMolecular models are loaded from the database Cactus - CADD Group Chemoinformatics Tools and User Services\n\n\n1.2 Building the molecule using SMILES\nNo, it is not a literal translation of “smiles”, but rather a coding of structures for text. In this format, you can load a molecule using SMILES codes, and the system fills in the complementary hydrogen atoms.\nTry this formatting at the address below.\n\nhttps://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=C\n\nThen replace the model of the link, “model=” with the following SMILES codes, alternatively:\n\n1. Single bond: CC, CN, CO\n2. Double bond: C=C, C=N, C=O\n3. Triple bond: N%23N, CC%23C\n\nNote: Although it seems strange (and it is!), the code for the triple bond is intended to circumvent the *SMILES* command, *“#”*, which is interpreted differently in internet addresses.\n\n\n\n1.3 Loading biopolymers (proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids) via command line\nAs mentioned above, biological macromolecules are loaded by identifying an alphanumeric code from the PDB-Protein Data Bank database. After obtaining this code, you can load the biopolymer via the online link or the Console. But be aware that the instructions are different (and don’t ask me why?!):\n\nThrough the Console:\nload=XXXX # where XXXX is the macromolecule code\n# Note: Note that the \"$\" sign is replaced by \"=\" for the PDB\n\nThrough the online link:\npdbid=XXXX\n# Note: As the link is more complicated, here is a complete example for bungarotoxin, a snake protein toxin:\n# https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?&pdbid=1ik8\n\nThis can be illustrated by remotely loading the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as follows:\n\n1. Go to the PDB-Protein Data Bank website - https://www.rcsb.org/ ;\n2. In the search field, type \"spike sars-cov-2\" ;\n3. Select the first option (the website will direct you to several structures of the spike protein);\n4. Memorize the code of the first option (although any of them will work), i.e., \"7FCD\";\n5. Enter the line to load the protein: \"load=7FCD\" (upper or lower case letters are acceptable)\n\nThe default representation for proteins in Jmol is wireframe. To view the virus protein in a more “friendly” way, similar to how it appears in texts or on the internet, enter the commands below, your first sequence in programming language.\n\ncartoon only # exclusive representation of the biopolymer structure\ncolor chain # coloring by protein \"chains\"\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation of the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (coloring by number of chains).\n\n\nProteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, and macromolecular associations are more relevant to the study of structural Biochemistry. In this regard, I invite you to visit a section of the website that has detailed descriptions and representations of Biochemistry structures with the help of Jmol."

Suppose you want to make a simple graph, taking two columns, each for a variable (independent or x, and dependent, or y). The usual thing to do would be to click on a menu item for graphs, select the desired columns in specific fields in the window that opens, select the graph type, click on next or some similar term, select other characteristics (labels or names on the x and y axes, for example), and finally click on finish (or OK, or a term with a similar meaning). Simple, quick, and practical.\nBut (there’s always a “but”)…what if, in addition to building the graph, you needed to perform additional actions, such as obtaining the linear fit of the data, displaying the resulting line with a specific color and style, inserting the equation of the line at a specific point on the graph, adding a title, and changing the symbol of the points, both the type, size and color. Phew!!!\nNo problem, either…as long as you have a good tutorial at your side, of course! Or that you are already familiar with the spreadsheet program, menus and actions related to the various mouse clicks that will be necessary to obtain a beautiful linear regression graph at the end.\nNow…one more small variable to add to the example given: suppose that it is not you who builds the graph, but a student in your discipline, and that they have not been trained in the use of the spreadsheet, nor in the intended calculations!\nNote that now there will be some discomfort, since:\n\nThe student has no prior knowledge in using the spreadsheet; 2. The student has no prior knowledge of the intended calculations;\nYou will have to train the student, or offer him/her a related training guide;\nIf the training has already taken place, but you do not have the guide at hand, both you and the student will depend on the memory retention capacity to successfully complete the task.\n\nNow, what if the instructions for executing the final product were not in a guide for repeating mouse clicks, but in a short text containing both the commands in sequence and the explanatory comments for each individual action, and that when inserted into the program generated the graph already formatted, colored, and with the linear adjustment and the result parameters?"

Separating the commands by \";\" - ex: \"cpk only; color blue\"\n2. Separating the commands by lines - ex:\n\"cpk only\ncolor blue\"\n\nIf you want the model to perform a few commands, the best option is to separate them with a semicolon (“;”). But if you want something more “sophisticated”, it is suggested to separate them with lines. And more… lines commented and written in a notepad or any text editor!\n\nAdvantages of using a notepad or text editor for serial commands\nImagining a more significant transformation to the original loaded molecule, such as magnification, coloring, and representation and movement effects, it is easy to see that a set of commented lines arranged in sequence makes it easier to observe what is intended with the model, as well as to identify errors and adjustments.\nThis is also inherited from the concepts of Reproducible Teaching, since it facilitates the visualization of the code (human readable format) and its debugging (code debug).

Remote loading for protein, enzyme and nucleic acid models involves knowing the PDB code of these, or searching for keywords on the Protein Data Brookhaven website.\nLoading molecules stored on the PC involves a few steps, namely:\n\nObtain the molecule model from the Internet, or build it;\nDownload the file corresponding to the model (usually with a *.mol, *.cif, *.cml, *.sdf attribute, among more than 60 formats);\nLoad the JSmol page using two alternative methods:\n\n\n1. By clicking the mouse: File --&gt; Load --&gt; Open local file ;\n2. By dragging the file from the folder where it is located to the JSmol tab in the browser.\n\n\nFor example, let’s say you want to view the structure of aspirin downloaded to your computer.\n\nNow it’s up to you:\n\nAccess the Pubchem website: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nType aspirin in the field and click on the 3D image that appears; 1. Download the model by clicking on Download Coordinates, and then clicking on the SDF option;\nClick on the 1st link to open the aspirin information Download the aspirin structural model from PubChem;\nOpen the JSmol Console in the browser (right-click on the screen and select “Console”);\nAlternatively:\n\n\nLocate the file on your PC by “File–&gt;Load–&gt;Open local file”, then clicking on “Load” to load it;\nClick on the downloaded file (“aspirin.sdf”, for example) and drag it directly to the JSmol window.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Loading the molecule via command line\nLoading a particular model via the command line is limited to searching for it on the Internet, in a database or on web pages. To do this, open the Console as explained above. The top part is used to display the results of the commands, and the bottom part is used to type them. In this case, click on the bottom frame of the Console and type the loading command, exemplified here for an alkane:\n\nload $alkane\n\nThe Jmol Console, although it is its own programming language for commands, has an interesting advantage over other programming languages: it is possible to execute the command via the Console with both upper and lower case letters, and in both the singular and plural.\nYou can try with other molecules, such as aspirin, cholesterol, phenol etc (names in English, because of the database). To retrieve a command line that was written previously, simply navigate between the commands that were used with the up and down arrows on the keyboard (command history).\nMolecular models are loaded from the Cactus - CADD Group Chemoinformatics Tools and User Services database.\n\n\nLoading biopolymers (proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids) via the command line\nAs mentioned above, loading biological macromolecules occurs by identifying an alphanumeric code for the same in front of the PDB-Protein Data Bank database. After obtaining this code, you can load the biopolymer via the online link or via the Console. But know that they are different instructions (and don’t ask me why?!):\n\nBy Console:\nload=XXXX # where XXXX is the code of the macromolecule\n# Note: Note that the \"$\" sign is replaced by \"=\" for the PDB\n\nBy online link:\npdbid=XXXX\n# Note: Since the link is more \"tricky\", here is a complete example for bungarotoxin, a protein venom of snakes:\n# https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?&pdbid=1ik8\n\nThis can be illustrated by remotely loading the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, as follows:\n\n1. Access the PDB-Protein Data Bank website - https://www.rcsb.org/ ; 2. In the search field, type \"spike sars-cov-2\";\n3. Select the 1st option (the site will direct you to several structures of the spike protein);\n4. Memorize the code of the 1st option (although any one will do), that is, \"7FCD\";\n5. Type the line to load the protein: \"load=7FCD\" (it doesn't matter if it's upper or lower case)\n\nThe default representation for proteins in Jmol is wireframe. To visualize the virus protein in a more “friendly” way, and similar to what appears in texts or on the internet, type the commands below, your first sequence in programming language.\n\ncartoon only # exclusive representation of the drawing of the structure of biopolymers\ncolor chain # coloring by \"chains\" of the protein\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation of the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (coloring by number of chains).\n\n\nProteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, and macromolecular associations are more relevant to the study of structural Biochemistry. In this sense, I invite you to visit a part of the authorial website that has detailed descriptions and representations of biochemical structures with the help of Jmol, the Bioquanti website\n\n\n\nBioquanti, an authorial website for quantitative studies in Biochemistry, and which includes several molecular models for Jmol."

Thus, Jmol can render the model as rod, wireframe, space-filled, ball and stick, trace, and cartoon (all in English, of course - cpk, wireframe, trace, cartoon).\nTry these styles, including the only option. This option allows the action not to be superimposed on the previous ones (in this case, the superimposition of the representations). To do this, copy, paste, and execute on each separate line the following code snippet in the Jmol Console, whose rendering illustrates the fluoxetine molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\nload $fluoxetine # load the molecule\nwireframe only # wireframe style\ncpk only # filled space\ncpk 20 only, bond 1 # balls and sticks\ncartoon only # cartoon representation, but that does not occur with small molecules, only with biomacromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, for example)\n\nAlso note that the cartoon representation does not result in a rendering for the fluoxetine model. This is because cartoon representation is restricted to biopolymers only, e.g., proteins and nucleic acids, and some supramolecular associations.\nHowever, if you want to try the cartoon, you will need to know the alphanumeric code of a protein or nucleic acid. For example, for myoglobin, an oxygen transport protein in mammals (code: 1mcy)\n\nload=1mcy # loading myoglobin\n\n# Note: note that the command line for biopolymers is slightly different from the one used for small molecules\n\nNote that the default rendering for large molecules is balls and sticks, which is not very didactic for the learner. In this case, it can be represented as an exclusive drawing by typing:\n\ncartoon only # rendering in drawing\n\nTo obtain this and other protein and nucleic acid codes, you must access the PDB - Protein Data Bank, RCSB database and type the name in the search field (in this case, myoglobin). The system returns several structural models and their codes, and you just need to transcribe one of these codes to the JSmol Console.\nIf you would like to learn a little more about biomolecules and the use of Jmol, I invite you to visit our Quantitative Biochemistry portal. There you will also find other applications for Jmol, R and RStudio, as well as a program that simulates transformations of elements present in schemes (diagrams, flowcharts, pedigrees, networks and webs) by differences in luminance between the element and its predecessor/successor (SISMA - Autocatalytic Map System)."

    "section": "Molecular characteristics",
    "text": "Molecular characteristics\nThere are several tangible pieces of information for a molecular model in Jmol. For example, the most basic ones for the molecule of a component of shoyo sauce, glutamate:\n\nCharges\nSometimes it may be interesting to present the polarity of molecules as a function of their charge distribution. In Jmol there are two types of charges, effective charge (formaCharge) and partial charge (partialcharge). We can illustrate the charge distribution in a surfactant molecule, such as hexadecanoate.\n.\nTo do this, type the following commands in the Console:\n\nload $hexadecanoate\ncalculate partialCharge # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %P # presentation of charges (labeling)\n\nA feature of Jmol that makes it more efficient in executing its actions is the sequential arrangement of commands. This way, it is not necessary to press Enter for each command, simply separate the commands with a semicolon (;) as illustrated below, to calculate the partial charges of the glutamate molecule:\n\n\n\nDisplay of partial charges in the glutamate model, a component of Shoyo sauce, also illustrating a sequence of actions in Jmol.\n\n\nIn the same way, it is possible to illustrate the obtaining of formal charges in the model. In this case, transparent coloring was added to better visualize the negative unitary charge of the carboxylic acid:\n\ncalculate formalcharges # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %C # presentation of charges (labeling)\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the commands in sequence to visualize formal charges in the glutamate molecule.\n\n\nNote that the commands in the figure mix upper and lower case letters, unlike the command line that precedes it. This is a really cool feature of Jmol, which doesn’t care about the capitalization or not of the font. In other words, it doesn’t matter if it’s lower case, upper case or a combination of both; Jmol executes the action in the same way.\n\nScripts & Reproducible Teaching\nThe example above shows a simple way to concatenate commands, facilitating the automatic and sequential execution of a set of these. However, the visualization of the command line is somewhat impaired by the separation by “;”, which can cause visual pollution when there are several commands.\nThe workaround involves the arrangement of the commands in the format of a script. This is nothing more than a code snippet containing one command per line, which improves the visualization of the code as a whole. In addition, the script has the additional advantage of inserting comments between the command lines, also allowing for better appropriation of the code and its learning.\nThese characteristics of a command per line with explanatory comments give Jmol its aspect for programming sequential actions, and consequently establishes one of the basic premises for Reproducible Teaching: writing code snippets in unitary commands per line, written as in a notepad, and with comments about the program’s actions on each line.\nAs an example for a script involving the actions for glutamate above, just copy the snippet below and paste it into the JSmol Console, and run it.\n\nload $glu # micromolecule loading\nwireframe only # exclusive rendering of rods\ncalculate partialCharge # partial charge\nlabel %P\n\nAnother aspect inherent to the Reproducible Teaching initiative lies in the possibility of evaluating the code with some changes, aiming for a slightly modified final product. Try repeating the snippet above, but for effective charges, that is:\n\nload $glu # micromolecule loading\ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\ncalculate formalCharge # effective charge\nlabel %C\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to act by changing more code commands, in order to create a result completely different from the original. This defines another characteristic of Reproducible Teaching, namely, the creation of a code snippet. As an illustration, here is a snippet based on the previous one, but for energy minimization and restructuring of the molecule’s orbitals.\n\nload $glu # micromolecule loading\ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\nminimize # command for minimizing the structure's energy"

Recently, a portable application for graphic and interactive simulation available on the website, JSPlotly, was awarded first place in the same award and is also available on eduCAPES. With equal honor and satisfaction, we also had works classified in the National Award in its previous editions, this time for experimental work in teaching and learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nBioquanti currently offers topics for higher education in biochemistry, although due to its quantitative nature, it also includes content on physical chemistry, chemistry, biophysics, descriptive and inferential statistics, experimental design, linear algebra, integral calculus, differential calculus, and computational modeling, among others; The language is geared toward university professors and researchers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.\n\n\n\nBioquanti for elementary and secondary education\nFor basic education, the website offers a set of instructional content and teaching objects for the final years of elementary school and high school. Its content was also designed according to the principles of reproducible teaching (RT) and involves interactive reproducible teaching objects (IRTO) for curricular content.\nIn this sense, the website presents applications of the JSPlotly (simulator) and GSPlotly (code generator) platforms directly aimed at basic education content. The website also has a tutorial on the practical use of Jmol for 3D molecules and interactivity, and another for R in the RStudio environment, for interactive graphics and maps. The tools are presented in their cloud versions, eliminating the need for installation or configuration, although there are instructions for installing the program on a machine. The tutorial is illustrated with examples taken from MAPA (Pedagogical Support Material for Learning in Minas Gerais). This content can also be accessed in the ebook Bringing Content to Life for Basic Education: Molecules, Graphics, and Interactive Maps, an adaptation for a smooth learning curve of Jmol and R & RStudio, and directly applied in the construction of reproducible interactive teaching objects (RITO) for school content.\nThe portal also provides a collection of interactive atomic models included in a “Molecule Garden” and a repository for interactive graphics and maps as RITO. The Molecule Garden is organized into classes and has a collection of atomic models for three-dimensional visualization and study."

To reduce these emissions, it is necessary to transform the current energy matrix, industry, and food systems.\n\n\nTo understand CO\\(_{2}\\) emissions in Brazil from 1890 to 2022, run the following code snippet in an R script (i.e., copy, paste, and run) from the source Our World in Data.\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(readr) # data import library\nlibrary(dplyr) # library for using the pipe operator \"%&gt;%\"\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Loading data from the internet\nurl &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv\"\nco2_data &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n# Filtering data for Brazil using subset()\nco2_brasil &lt;- subset(co2_data, country == \"Brazil\")\n\n# Creating an interactive graph with plot_ly\nco2_plot &lt;- plot_ly(data = co2_brasil, x = ~year, y = ~co2, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %&gt;%\nlayout(title = \"CO2 emissions in Brazil over the years\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"Year\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"CO2 emissions (million tons)\"))\n\nNow, the icing on the cake. The insertion of a slider to select ranges for a more focused study.\n\nco2_plot %&gt;%\nrangeslider()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can copy and paste the scripts in sequence for execution, or just add the command rangeslider() with the pipe operator %&gt;% at the end.\nNow try positioning the mouse on one of the two side markers of the lower graph, dragging it, and observe the result. The slider can be useful when you want to focus on a specific region of the graph. For example, to adjust CO₂ emissions for the last few years.\n\n1.1.1 Adding a drop-down menu\nDropdown menus allow you to view a different graph for each option selected. To illustrate this interactive feature, let’s first create a dataset that has linear, quadratic, and cubic responses to an independent variable, as follows:\n\nx = 1:10 # vector of the independent variable \"x\"\nyLin = x\nyQuad = x^2 # creation of the quadratic dependent variable \nyCub = x^3 # creation of the cubic dependent variable \n\ndatLQC &lt;-data.frame(x,yLin,yQuad,yCub) # creation of the data sheet\n\nNow we can insert the dropdown menu for selecting mathematical trends:\n\nplot_ly(datLQC, x = ~x, y = ~yLin, type = \"scatter\", mode = \"line\", name = \"Linear\") %&gt;%\n  add_trace(x = ~x, y = ~yQuad, mode = \"line\", name = \"Quadrático\") %&gt;%\n  add_trace(x = ~x, y = ~yCub, mode = \"line\", name = \"Cúbico\") %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Gráficos de potência\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"x\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"x^n\"),\n    updatemenus = list(\n      list(\n        buttons = list(\n          list(label = \"yLin\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)))),\n          list(label = \"yQuad\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)))),\n          list(label = \"yCub\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))))\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you may find the code snippet above a little complicated, just copy it, paste it into a script, and run it. This exemplifies the essence inherent in Reproducible Teaching, from the simple reproduction of code to its alteration and even the creation of new code. If you are curious, you can change some terms in the code above, such as the labels (label, replace a name, for example) that appear in the drop-down menu, the type of graph you want (replace scatter with bar, for example), or the title of the graph (title).\n\n\nIn terms of interactivity, the selection of the type of power to be represented by the drop-down menu is added to those already present in the plot_ly command.\n\n\nAs with many R packages, there are a significant number of commands and interactive widgets with plotly, which, in this specific case, would provide enough material for a separate book. However, you can consult numerous websites about plotly for more comprehensive learning, the links below, and even a free online book with related codes and graphics. To see the immense wealth of interactive graphics, take a look at the plotly website (https://plotly.com/r/) for R.\n\n\n\nGeneral\nManual\nTutorial"

    "text": "2 Molecular characteristics\nThere is a lot of tangible information about a molecular model in Jmol. Here are some examples of the most basic information for the molecule of a component of shoyo sauce, glutamate:\n\n2.1 Charges\nSometimes it can be interesting to show the polarity of molecules based on their charge distribution. In Jmol there are two types of charges, effective charge (formaCharge) and partial charge (partialcharge). We can illustrate the charge distribution in a surfactant molecule, such as hexadecanoate.\n\n\n\nExample of a 16-carbon surfactant, hexadecenoic acid. Source: MAPA: high school - 3rd semester, 3rd year, p.63. Natural sciences and their technologies.\n\n\nTo do this, type the following commands in the Console:\n\nload $hexadecanoate\ncalculate partialCharge # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %P # presentation of charges (labeling)\n\nA feature of Jmol that makes it more efficient to execute actions is the sequential arrangement of commands. This way, it is not necessary to click Enter for each command, just separate the commands with semicolons (;) as illustrated below, to calculate the partial charges of the glutamate molecule:\n\n\n\nPresentation of partial charges in the glutamate model, a component of Shoyo sauce, also illustrating a sequence of actions in Jmol.\n\n\nSimilarly, the obtaining of formal charges in the model can be illustrated. In this case, transparent coloring was added for better visualization of the negative unit charge of the carboxylic acid:\n\ncalculate formalcharges # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %C # presentation of charges (labeling)\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the commands in sequence for viewing formal charges in the glutamate molecule.\n\n\nNote that the commands in the figure mix upper and lower case letters, unlike the command line that precedes them. This is a cool feature of Jmol, which does not care about font capitalization. In other words, it does not matter if you use lower case, upper case, or a combination of both; Jmol performs the action in the same way.\n\n2.1.1 Scripts & Reproducible Teaching\nThe example above shows a simple way to concatenate commands, facilitating the automatic and sequential execution of a set of them. However, the command line view is somewhat impaired by the separation with “;”, which can cause visual pollution when there are several commands.\nThe workaround involves arranging the commands in a script format. This is nothing more than a piece of code containing one command per line, which improves the visualization of the code as a whole. In addition, the script has the added advantage of allowing comments to be inserted between command lines, also allowing for better appropriation of the code and its learning.\nThese characteristics of a command line with explanatory comments give Jmol its aspect for programming sequential actions, and consequently establish one of the basic premises for Reproducible Teaching: the writing of code snippets in single-line commands, written as in a notepad, with comments on the program’s actions on each line.\nAs an example for a script involving the actions for glutamate above, just copy the snippet below and paste it into the JSmol Console, then execute it.\n\nload $glu # loading micromolecule \nwireframe only # exclusive rendering of rods\ncalculate partialCharge # partial charge\nlabel %P \n\nAnother aspect inherent to the Reproducible Teaching initiative is the possibility of evaluating the code with some changes, aiming at a slightly modified final product. Try repeating the above snippet, but for effective charges, that is:\n\nload $glu # loading micromolecule \ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\ncalculate formalCharge # effective charge \nlabel %C \n\nIn addition, you can change more commands in the code to create a result that is completely different from the original. This defines another feature of Reproducible Teaching, namely code snippet creation. To illustrate, here is an excerpt based on the previous one, but for energy minimization and restructuring of the molecule’s orbitals.\n\nload $glu # micromolecule loading \ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\nminimize # command for structure energy minimization"

A versão básica de um gráfico 3D é bem simples de se executar no plotly, e seu efeito visual e de interatividade são bem expressivos !\n      Um exemplo de gráfico 3D pode ser obtido das relações de raio, área superficial, e volume de uma esfera, tal como segue.\n\n\n\nRelações matemáticas de área superficial e de volume de uma esfera em função de seu raio.

O mais simples seria com as etiquetas com os nomes padrão, x, y e z. Mas é melhor acrescentar o comando layout para dar significado físico e melhorar a interpretação do gráfico.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Dados:\nr = seq(0,100, length.out = 50)\nAreaSup = 4*pi*r^2 # cálculo de área superficial da esfera\nVolume = 4/3*pi*r^3 # cálculo do volume da esfera\n\n# Gráfico:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = r, y = AreaSup, z = Volume, \n        mode= 'markers+lines')%&gt;%\n  layout(scene = list(\n         xaxis=list(title=\"raio\"),\n         yaxis=list(title=\"área superficial\"),\n         zaxis=list(title=\"volume\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Observe que o gráfico é interativo também sobre outros aspectos, como sua rotação em qualquer dos 3 eixos. Sob o ponto de vista de conteúdo, esse gráfico ilustra como que os valores de área superficial, e mais ainda de volume, são enormemente variados em função do raio de uma esfera. Isso também justifica em parte o grande sucesso do uso de nanopartículas em Ciência e Tecnologia nos dias atuais (alta área de superfície em tamanho reduzido).\n      Outro gráfico tridimensional interessante é o de superfície 3D. Como o de cima, poucas linhas são necessárias para defini-lo. A diferença é que você pode trabalhar com uma equação,para a superfície, veja:\n\nx &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 50)\ny &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 50)\nz &lt;- outer(x, y, function(x, y) x^2 - y^2) # equação x^2+y^2\n\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, type = 'surface') %&gt;%\n  layout(title = \"Gráfico de Superfície\")\n\n\n\n\n\n      Existem outros tipos de gráficos para o plotly, pelo que vale uma visitinha ao website para mais informações."

    "text": "1 Creating an interactive graph\nLet’s start by creating the data from an equation applied to a vector. To do this, we need…the vector! Think of a vector as a column (or row) in Excel. In R, vectors are created by concatenating values separated by commas, as follows:\n\nx = c(1,2,3,4,5) # a vector; the \"c\" indicates \"concatenation\"\n# assigns values from 1 to 5 to the variable \"x\"\n\n# Alternatively,\n\nx = 1:5 # also assigns values from 1 to 5 to the variable \"x\"\n\nTo create the interactive graph, let’s illustrate the vertical launch equation below. This image, as well as the others used to illustrate the potential use of R & RStudio in basic education, were extracted from the notebooks of MAPA (Educational Support Material for Learning in Minas Gerais.\n\n\nNow we will make an interactive graph from this data. But first, of course, you need to install the plotly package in R. You can install it from the Packages tab in RStudio, if you haven’t already, and as explained in the previous section on Packages.\n\n\nFinal step… build a scatter plot of the vertical rise function.\nTo do this, simply copy the snippet below and paste it into a new R script. Then run it in any of the ways mentioned in the previous section.\n\n\n\n# Data:\nt = 1:20 # defines the time vector\nVo = 100 # initial velocity, 100 m/s\ng = 9.8 # acceleration due to gravity, m/s^2\n\n# Equation (vertical rise):\n\nH = Vo*t-1/2*g*t^2\n\n# Interactive graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = ~t, y = ~H)\n\n\n\n\n# Note:\n# Plotly syntax: ~variable, to assign a variable (x or y)\n# type: to assign a graph type\n\nR usually displays some messages (Warnings) after running the commands. These are not errors, but additional information, such as in the reproduction of the previous graph. In this case, the information is that the type of graph is missing, a scatter plot:\n\nplot_ly(x = t, y = H, type = 'scatter')\n\nNow observe how much interactivity has emerged with the simple command above, by moving the mouse over the points on the graph, or by clicking on the icons that appeared above the graph. Test this interactivity:\n\nHovering the mouse over the points on the graph will give you the coordinates of each point;\nUsing the mouse scroll wheel will zoom in or out on the graph\nLeft-clicking anywhere on the graph and drawing a rectangle will zoom in on that area;\nDouble-clicking after zooming in will return you to the original graph;\nPositioning the mouse pointer between the values of an axis and dragging the mouse will cause the selected axis to shift;\nBy selecting an icon in the upper right corner of the graph, you can, in sequence from the left, download the plot as an image, zoom in, move the axes, select points within a box or within a loop, zoom in, zoom out, scale to the original size, realign the axes to those of the original plot, view the coordinates (x and y), view only the y coordinate, and return to the beginning."

    "text": "3 Working with mathematical relationships in variables\nWhen constructing a graph, it is sometimes useful to be able to perform a calculation on a variable without having to create a new vector. Let’s illustrate this with an isothermal transformation in the study of gases (Boyle-Mariotte’s law), as follows:\n\n\n\nRelationship between pressure and volume in an isothermal transformation. Source: MAPA: high school - Natural sciences and their technologies. 2nd semester. 3rd year, p.28.\n\n\nFor example, if you are working in a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel) and want to build a graph of the above relationship, say V versus p, you will have to set up a column with this operation. In plotly, as in R as a whole, this is not necessary, since p can be considered as a constant 1/V. In fact, this constant is represented by the general constant of ideal gases, R, of known value.\nSolving for the above situation:\n\n# Data:\nR = 8.314 # J/(mol*K), general constant of ideal gases\nV = seq(0.224, length.out=50) # vector of \"Volume\" (in liters), with 50 points\nT = 298 # K, absolute temperature\n\n\n# Equation\n# pV = RT; p = RT/V\np = R*T/V\n\n# Graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = V, y = ~R*T/V, type = 'scatter', mode='lines')\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you want to name the axis labels and give the graph a title to better convey the physical meaning of the quantities involved, just add the layout command as follows:\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(magrittr) # library for the pipe operator \"%&gt;%\"\nplot_ly(x = V, y = ~R*T/V, type = \"scatter\", mode=\"lines\") %&gt;%\nlayout(\ntitle = \"Isothermal Transformation of a Gas\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"Volume V, L\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"Pressure p, bar\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s your turn:\nOpen a new script and build a graph that shows any relationship between variables, as suggested below:\n\nCreate the values of the independent variable (e.g., x = 1:10);\n\nLoad the plotly library - library(plotly) ;\n\nEnter a general command line for the graph:\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~sqrt(x), type = \"scatter\")\n\nSelect these lines, press Ctrl+Enter, and observe the output (i.e., the graph, in the plots tab;\n\nModify the “y” variable, replacing the value of “x” with some other relationship, such as: ~exp(x) - exponential, ~sin(10*x) - sine, ~sqrt(x)` - square root;"

    "text": "2 Life expectancy & Gross Domestic Product\nA very interesting use of plot_ly in graphic animation is when we need to present various data on a given topic. This is called multivariate data. To illustrate this situation, let’s say we want to provide various information in a graph showing the relationship between a country’s gross domestic product and the life expectancy of its inhabitants over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome economic indicators associated with life expectancy in 2001. Source: MAPA: high school - Human sciences and their technologies. 1st semester, 2nd year, p.101.\n\n\nTo illustrate the interactive richness that can be obtained by plotly on the influence of gross domestic product - GDP on life expectancy, we can import a data set from the internet and create a graph on this relationship, see:\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Obtaining data from the internet\nurl &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpVida &lt;- url # assigning the data to an `R` object\n\n# Creating the interactive graph\nplot_ly(\ndadosExpVida, # data converted from the internet\nx = ~gdpPercap, # name of the per capita income column in the data\ny = ~lifeExp, # name of the life expectancy column in the data\ntype = 'scatter', # graph type (scatter)\nmode = 'markers' # scatter type (points)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! Simple, straightforward, and interactive code. If you hover your mouse over the points, you will see the coordinates of GDP and life expectancy. However, it is not possible to tell from this graph who is who, i.e., which country has which GDP, as well as other information contained in the original spreadsheet downloaded from the internet. To give you an idea, this spreadsheet contains, in addition to GDP and life expectancy values, the country and its population, the continent to which it belongs, as well as the year the data was measured.\n\n\nThus, we are faced with a set of multivariate data, which is very common in various databases, such as IBGE or DATASUS.\n\n\nHow about if we could present everything at once, i.e., GDP, life expectancy, the country, the size of the population, the continent, and the year in which all of this was measured, i.e., six variables, including numerical and categorical (classes) variables?\n\n\nImpossible?! Not for R!! Here is a snippet of code for that, with the proposed result. Don’t worry about the size or details. If you want to reproduce this code, you know what to do… just copy, paste, and run the code in an R script.\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Obtendo os dados na internet\nurl &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpVida &lt;- url  # atribuindo os dados a um objeto do `R`\n\n# Criando o gráfico interativo com animação\nplot_ly(\n  dadosExpVida, # dados convertidos da internet\n  x = ~gdpPercap, # renda per capita\n  y = ~lifeExp, # expectativa de vida\n  size = ~pop, # tamanho dos pontos em função da população\n  color = ~country, # cor dos pontos em função do país\n  frame = ~year,    # Frame para a animação por ano de coleta dos dados\n  text = ~continent,  # País como informação ao passar o mouse\n  hoverinfo = \"text\",\n  type = 'scatter', # tipo de gráfico\n  mode = 'markers',\n  marker = list(sizemode = 'diameter', opacity = 0.7)\n) %&gt;%\n  layout(  # atribuição de título e etiquetas dos eixos\n    title = \"Produto interno bruto X Expectativa de vida\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"PIB (log), US$\", type = \"log\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Expectativa de Vida, anos\"),\n    showlegend = TRUE # possibilidade ou não de aparecer a legenda\n  ) %&gt;%\n  animation_opts(\n    frame = 1000,           # Velocidade da animação\n    transition = 0,\n    redraw = TRUE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo go to the “playground” now, click PLAY and observe the temporal transition of life expectancy as a function of countries’ GDP. And note that all other data is there, separated by point size (population), color (country), continent (hover, mouse over), and year (animation frame or frame)!\n\n\nOne more detail! If you look at the legend, you will see that it is also sliding, identifying each country by color. Want to know where Brazil is in this crazy graph of GDP and life expectancy? Easy. Find Brazil in the legend, double-click, and notice that now only that point is highlighted."

    "text": "1 Why install packages?\nIn a simple answer, because each of the more than 21,000 R packages has an extension of resources that R itself does not have in its original installation. In other words, it extends the tool for a specific purpose, such as reproducing and even modifying code snippets that result in interactive teaching objects for basic education.\nFor this, we will use only two packages, plotly and leaflet. This means that the interactivity packages need to be installed before the code can be executed. But don’t worry. This is one of the easiest parts of working with R."
