An analytical solution (theoretical model) relies on a function containing one or more independent variables, a dependent variable, and one or more parameters to be determined, which together describe the problem situation. In contrast, a numerical solution does not depend on an explicit descriptive equation, but rather on approximations aimed at minimizing a general function (F(x) = 0). Numerical methods are employed when the theoretical model is complex, when an explicit solution is not desired, or when such a solution does not exist."

    "section": "1 Simulations",
    "text": "1 Simulations\n\n1.1 Acid–base equilibrium and buffer system\n\nContext:\n  The example illustrates the addition of base in a system containing a weak acid and its conjugate base. The titration equation refers to a triprotic acid, phosphoric acid of the homonymous buffer, but it would equally serve for many others, such as those present in the Krebs cycle (citrate, isocitrate).\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nfa= \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa1 - pH}} + \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa2 - pH}} + \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa3 - pH}}\n\\] Where, fa = acid fraction (protonable groups)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n\"A. Converting the phosphate buffer curve (triprotic) to bicarbonate buffer (diprotic)\"\n\n1. Change the pKa values to those of the bicarbonate buffer: pKa1 =      6.1, and pKa2 = 10.3;\n2. Set a very large value for pKa3 (e.g., 1e20). \n3. Click on \"add plot\".\n\nExplanation: pKa is a term that represents the logarithm of a dissociation constant (-log[Ka]). With an extreme value, the denominator also becomes immense, nullifying the term that carries pKa3. In JavaScript and other languages, \"e\" represents the notation for power of 10.\n\n\"B. Converting the bicarbonate buffer curve to acetate\"\n\n1. Just repeat the procedure above, with pKa1 = 4.75, and eliminating pKa2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Ionization state of chemical groups of biomolecules\n\nContext:\n  JSPlotly also allows the observation of some concepts facilitated by animation-based learning together with graphical representations obtained by mathematical functions. In the example that follows, the interactive object illustrates the protonation state for the main chemical groups found in biomolecules.\n\n\nInstruction\n\nAfter clicking the corresponding image below, click on “add” and observe the generated acid–base titration plot. The abscissa axis (x-axis) has an extensive range of pH values, and the ordinate axis the charge that the molecule with ionization potential manifests at each pH, and as a function of its pKa value;\nClick on “Animate” to observe the displacement of a small ball along the titration curve, up to a pH value pre-defined in the simulator script, and as a function of its pKa;\nModify in the script the type of ionizable group (in “let grupo_edit =”) and/or the desired final pH (“let pH_final_edit =”), to evaluate the ionization state of a new group;\nClick on “Reset” and “Animate”, to observe the new animation.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Change the pH and the type of group that is intended to be observed;\n2. Simulate the ionization state of different molecules, such as drugs with carboxylic acid (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid... aspirin), at blood pH and in the gastric cavity;\n3. Create a new ionizable group and predict its ionization state. For this, just change the information in 3 constants at the beginning of the script: groups, pKas, and types.\n  a. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Net charge network in peptides\n\nContext:\n  The code refers to the net charge network present in any sequence of amino acid residues. Here angiotensin II is illustrated, an important peptide for regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance, and whose converting enzyme is associated with the mechanism of cellular invasiveness by SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\nEquation:\n  For this simulation there is no direct equation, since the algorithm needs to decide the charge as a function of the basic or acidic nature of the residue at a given pH value (observe the script). Thus:\n\\[\nq =\n\\begin{cases}\n-\\dfrac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}} & \\text{(acid group)} \\\\\n\\dfrac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_a}} & \\text{(basic group)}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nWhere,\n\npKa = value of the base-10 antilogarithm for the equilibrium constant of acid dissociation, Ka (or log[Ka]).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Select the peptide sequence below, and observe the charge distribution:\n  \n\"Ala,Lys,Arg,Leu,Phe,Glu,Cys,Asp,His\"\n\n2. Simulate the stomach pH condition (\"const pH = 1.5\"), and verify the change of charges in the peptide. \n\n3. Select a physiological peptide (oxytocin, for example), observe its charge in blood (pH 7.5), and reflect on its potential for electrostatic interaction with cellular components.\n\n\"Cys,Tyr,Ile,Gln,Asn,Cys,Pro,Leu,Gly\"  - oxytocin\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Charge, pH, pKa & pI of amino acids (animation)\n\nContext:\n  This object addresses a different potential for JSPlotly, namely, animation-based learning. To illustrate this approach, an animation follows for observing the charge of an amino acid based on the value of its pKa, and on the information of its pI, the isoelectric point of the compound (pH value at which the species has zero net charge).\n  To visualize the charge value q (“current state”), click the “add” button followed by “Animate”. For another animation, just select the amino acid (“let aa_edit =”) and the final pH at which you wish to observe its charge (“let pH_final_edit =”). The animation also allows comparing the charge of a free amino acid with that of the corresponding residue in a polypeptide chain (option “let contexto_edit =”). Note that the animation provides a legend informing the pKa value of the compound for its ionizable groups.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Simulate the condition of an amino acid at blood pH and at stomach pH;\n2. Compare the pH values of a free amino acid, with that of its residue in a chain;\n3. Change the boolean option in \"const showSites\", to observe the curves of each ionizable group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 Isoelectric Point in Proteins\n\nContext:\n  The script for this simulation is based on the distribution of the net charge network for a polyelectrolyte, and the identification of the pH value at which this network is null, that is, the isoelectric (or isoeionic) point, pI. The example uses the primary sequence of lysozyme, a hydrolase that acts in breaking the microbial wall.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nq_{\\text{net}}(pH) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ n_i \\cdot q_{B_i} + \\frac{n_i}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a_i}}} \\right]\n\\]\nWhere,\n\nqnet = total net charge;\nqB$_{i} = charge of the basic form for residue i (for example, +1 for Lys, 0 for Asp);\nn\\(_{i}\\) = number of groups of residue i.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n\"Finding the pI for other proteins\"\n\n1. One can verify the titration of any other protein or peptide sequence by simply substituting the primary sequence contained in the code. An assertive way to perform this substitution involves:\n  a. Search for the \"FASTA\" sequence of the protein in NCBI (\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/\") - e.g.: \"papain\";\n  b. Click on \"FASTA\" and copy the sequence obtained in 1a.;\n  c. Paste the sequence into a site for residue quantification (e.g., \"https://www.protpi.ch/Calculator/ProteinTool\");\n4. Substitute the sequence in the code. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.6 Hydrophobicity in amino acid sequences\n\nContext:\n  Observing hydrophobicity levels of amino acids can be useful for the study and prediction of residue sequences, such as those found in the central portion of helices of transmembrane proteins, as for identification of specific sites in enzymes, such as clefts and hydrophobic pockets.\n  These levels are classified in a relative way, giving rise to some indices such as the Kyte–Doolittle scale, which assigns each amino acid a hydropathy value (hydrophobicity/hydrophobicity) estimated from experimental and observational data. Positive values indicate hydrophobic tendency (e.g., Ile, Val, Leu) and negative values indicate hydrophilic tendency (e.g., Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg). The index allows highlighting stretches prone to nonpolar environments, as well as regions exposed to the aqueous solvent.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\n\\tilde{y}*i ;=; \\frac{1}{w} \\sum*{k=i-m}^{i+m} y_k,\n\\qquad w = 2m+1\n\\]\n\nWhere,\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &:; \\text{hydrophobicity value at position $i$ of the sequence} \\\n\\tilde{y}_i &:; \\text{smoothed value (moving average) at position $i$} \\\nm &:; \\text{half-window (number of neighbors on each side)} \\\nw &:; \\text{total window width ($w=2m+1$)} \\\ni &:; \\text{amino acid position in the sequence ($1 \\leq i \\leq N$)}\n\\end{aligned}\\]\n:; \nm &:; \nw &:; \ni &:; \\end{aligned}\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing the sequence to a known one;\n2. Compare a polar sequence with a nonpolar one by overlay (\"add\");\n3. Transcribe a transmembrane helix sequence of a protein by accessing its data on the PDB site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7 Interaction of oxygen with myoglobin and hemoglobin\n\nContext:\n  The oxygen molecule can combine with the heme group of myoglobin and hemoglobin in a distinct way, as a function of the cooperativity exhibited in the latter relative to its quaternary structure. The following model exemplifies this interaction, by use of the Hill equation.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nY= \\frac{pO_2^{nH}}{p_{50}^{nH} + pO_2^{nH}}\n\\]\n\nWhere\n\nY = degree of oxygen saturation in the protein;\npO\\(_{2}\\) = oxygen pressure;\np\\(_{50}\\) = oxygen pressure at 50% saturation;\nnH = Hill coefficient for the interaction;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Run the application (\"add plot\"). See that the value of \"nH\" of the Hill constant is \"1\", that is, without cooperativity effect.\n\n2. Now replace the value of \"nH\" with the Hill coefficient for hemoglobin, 2.8, and run again !\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.8 Bohr effect in hemoglobin (pH)\n\nContext:\n  Some physiological or pathological conditions can alter the binding affinity of oxygen with hemoglobin, such as temperature, some metabolites (2,3-BPG), and the hydrogen ion content of the solution.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nY(pO_2) = \\frac{{pO_2^n}}{{P_{50}^n + pO_2^n}}, \\quad \\text{with } P_{50} = P_{50,\\text{ref}} + \\alpha (pH_{\\text{ref}} - pH)\n\\]\nWhere,\n\nY = hemoglobin saturation,\npO\\(_{2}\\) = partial pressure of oxygen (in mmHg),\nP\\(*{50}\\) = pressure of O\\(*{2}\\) at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated,\nP\\(_{50,ref}\\) = 26 mmHg (standard value),\n\\(\\alpha\\) = 50 (intensity of the Bohr effect),\npH\\(_{ref}\\) = 7.4,\nn = 2.8 = Hill coefficient for hemoglobin.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try altering the reference pH for the interaction;\n2. Simulate other allosteric models by changing the value of \"n\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9 Catalysis and enzymatic inhibition\n\nContext:\n  The simulation that follows aims to offer a general equation for enzymatic inhibition studies, which contemplates the competitive, uncompetitive and competitive (pure or mixed) models, also allowing the study of enzymatic catalysis in the absence of inhibitor.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nv=\\frac{Vm*S}{Km(1+\\frac{I}{Kic})+S(1+\\frac{I}{Kiu})}\n\\]\nWhere\n\nS = substrate content for the reaction;\nVm = limiting velocity of the reaction (in books, maximum velocity);\nKm = Michaelis–Menten constant;\nKic = inhibitor dissociation equilibrium constant for the competitive model;\nKiu = inhibitor dissociation equilibrium constant for the uncompetitive model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n\"A. Enzymatic catalysis in the absence of inhibitor.\"\n1. Just run the application with the general equation. See that the values for Kic and Kiu are high (1e20). In this way, with high \"dissociation constants\", the interaction of the inhibitor with the enzyme is irrelevant, returning the model to the classic Michaelis–Menten equation.\n2. Try changing the values of Vm and Km, comparing plots.\n3. Use the geographic coordinates feature of the icon bar (\"Toggle Spike Lines\"), to consolidate the mathematical meaning of Km, as well as observe the effect of distinct values of this on the visualization of the plot.\n\n\"B. Competitive inhibition model.\"\n1. To observe or compare the michaelian model with the competitive inhibition model, just replace the value of Kic with a consistent number (e.g., Kic= 3).\n\n\"C. Uncompetitive inhibition model.\"\n1. The same suggestion above serves for the uncompetitive model, this time replacing the value for Kiu.\n \n\"D. Pure noncompetitive inhibition model.\"\n1. In this model, the simulation is given by equal values for Kic and Kiu.\n\n\"E. Mixed noncompetitive inhibition model.\"\n1. For this model, just allocate distinct values for Kic and Kiu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10 Linearization of kinetic data by Lineweaver–Burk\n\nContext\n  One of the (many) difficulties in learning Biochemistry refers to literacy for interpreting plots. Among these, the hyperbolic nature of the michaelian model is alternatively treated by several transformations of the variables S and v, standing out in the literature the linearization by double-reciprocal, or Lineweaver–Burk transformation.\n  The example that follows illustrates the relationship between the dependent and independent variables of the original and transformed model, using another feature of the Plotly.js library: the possibility of cross-selection of points.\n  To observe this functionality, select a set of points in one of the subplots of the plot that follows, and observe their automatic selection in the other subplot.\n\n\n1.10.1 Equation\n  The linear transformation of Lineweaver–Burk is given below:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{S}*\\frac{Km}{Vm} + \\frac{1}{Vm}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try selecting the extremes of the Michaelis–Menten plot (hyperbolic curve), and observe the same points in the double-reciprocal. Which values are more reliable in the latter, the first or the last?\n\n2. Research other forms of linearization (e.g., Eadie–Hofstee; \"v/S\" X \"v\"), and see how the transformation and point selection presents itself. For this, change the constants below:\n    const invS = S.map(s =&gt; 1/s);\n    const invV = V.map(v =&gt; 1/v);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.11 Diagnosis of Enzymatic Inhibition (Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk)\n\nContext\n  As presented above and present in texts of the area, it is possible to linearize the Michaelis–Menten curve for a simpler observation for diagnosing enzymatic inhibition models. The object below proposes this interpretation. For this, keep the control enzyme without addition of inhibitor in the code (I=0). To seek an inhibition model, insert a value for I and change the inhibitor dissociation equilibrium constant(s), kic and/or kiu.\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Simulate the conditions for a competitive inhibition, inserting a value for the inhibitor content (\"I\") and changing the value of \"Km\";\n2. Do the same for an uncompetitive model, although changing the value of \"Vm\";\n3. Try the pure noncompetitive model, changing \"Km\" and \"Vm\" to the same value;\n4. Test mixed competitive inhibition, inserting distinct values for \"Km\" and for \"Vm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.12 van der Waals equation for ideal gases\n\nContext:\n  An adaptation that relates the thermodynamic quantities of pressure, volume and temperature for ideal gases, is the van der Waals equation. In this, coefficients are computed that estimate the existence of a volume and inter-particle interactions. Thus, the van der Waals equation corrects the ideal gas equation considering a term to compensate intermolecular forces (a/V\\(^{2}\\)) and the available volume, this discounting the volume occupied by the gas molecules themselves.\n  In the simulation an additional interactivity is offered by the presence of sliders (sliding controls) for temperature, and for the coefficients of finite volume (b) and interaction between particles (a).\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{RT}{V - b} - \\frac{a}{V^2}\n\\]\n\nP = gas pressure (atm);\nV = molar volume (L);\nT = temperature (K);\nR = 0.0821 = ideal gas constant (L·atm/mol·K);\na = intermolecular attraction constant (L\\(^{2}\\)·atm/mol$^{2})\nb = excluded volume constant (L/mol)\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try varying the parameters of the equation by means of the \"slider\" for temperature, as well as for the coefficients \"a and b\".\n2. Discuss which of the coefficients has the greatest effect on the curve profile, and the reason for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.13 Equilibrium of ATP production from reagents, temperature, and pH\n\nContext:\n  Intracellular ATP production involves the classic relationship of chemical equilibrium between reagents and products as a function of reaction temperature, and adjusted for a given pH value. By varying one and/or another reagent content, or physicochemical parameter, it is possible to quantify the product by the thermodynamic reaction that follows:\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\n\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ'} + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\text{ADP}] \\cdot [\\text{P}_i]}{[\\text{ATP}]}\\right) + 2{,}303 \\cdot RT \\cdot n_H \\cdot \\text{pH}\n\\]\nWhere,\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)G = Gibbs energy of the reaction (positive for spontaneously unfavorable synthesis, kJ/mol);\n\\(\\Delta\\)G\\(^{o'}\\) = 30.5 kJ/mol biological standard Gibbs energy for ATP synthesis;\nR = 8.314 J/mol/K (general gas constant);\nT=310 K (physiological temperature);\nnH\\(^{+}\\) = 1 (number of protons involved in the reaction);\n[ADP], [Pi], [ATP] = molar concentrations of reagents and product\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Change the quantities involved in the expression, and compare with previous visualizations. For example, temperature, pH, and ADP and Pi contents.\n\n\n\n\n1.14 Variation of Gibbs energy with temperature\n\nContext:\n  The Gibbs–Helmholtz relationship predicts that Gibbs energy varies in a non-linear way with temperature, in reactions that involve a change in the heat capacity of the system (\\(\\Delta\\)Cp). This expanded form of the Gibbs equation for variable heat capacity is presented in several biochemical phenomena, such as in phase transition of biomembrane structure subjected to a compound challenge, or in the conformational change that accompanies protein structure under heating. \\\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\n\\Delta G(T) = \\Delta H^\\circ - T,\\Delta S^\\circ + \\Delta C_p \\left(T - T_0 - T \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)\\right)\n\\]\nWhere,\n\n\\(\\Delta\\)G(T) = Gibbs energy of the reaction at each temperature value, kJ/mol);\n\\(\\Delta\\)H\\(^{o}\\) = standard enthalpy of the reaction at T\\(_{0}\\), usually 298 K (J/mol);\n\\(\\Delta\\)S\\(^{o}\\) = standard entropy of the reaction at T\\(_{0}\\);\n\\(\\Delta\\)Cp = change in heat capacity of the reaction (J/mol·K), assumed constant with temperature;\nT = temperature of interest (K);\nT\\(_{0}\\) = reference temperature, generally 298 K.\nR = 8.314 J/mol/K (general gas constant);\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try varying one or more parameters of the expression;\n2. Test the behavior of the Gibbs curve at an elevated reference temperature (simulation for an extremophile organism);\n3. Simulate the situation where the heat capacity change is null\n\n\n\n\n1.15 Oxygen consumption by mitochondria\n\nContext:\n  Oxygraphs are equipment that monitor the content of dissolved oxygen in solution. Different from oximeters, based on measuring hemoglobin oxygenation by a direct clip on the tip of a finger, oxygraphs are widely used in studies of living cells and suspensions of mitochondria.\n  The example that follows illustrates an animation for the content of \\(O_{2}\\) measured in an oxygraph for a suspension of mitochondria, and whose consumption rates are varied by the use of modifying metabolites (e.g., pyruvate, ADP, azide).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Note that the appearance of metabolites and the resulting oxygen consumption rates are defined by the function \"oxigenio\". Try changing them and observe the effect in the animation;\n2. Realize that the metabolites and their action, as well as the measured signal, O2 content, are easily adapted for any other metabolic measurement in the code. Try, for example, what the plot would look like in a simulation for the glycolytic pathway;\n3. This code was designed for an animation. Go to the \"Applications\" section below, and try \"FlowForces\" for a similar purpose, although with full interactive adaptation.\n\n\n\n\n1.16 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)\n\nContext:\n      Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an analytical technique that measures the response of an electrochemical system to a small-amplitude sinusoidal perturbation (e.g., 5–10 mV), applied over a wide frequency range (e.g., 100 kHz–1 mHz). EIS allows obtaining information about interfacial processes, such as charge transfer, ion diffusion and formation of passive films, through analysis of the complex impedance of the system. It is a non-destructive technique, widely used in areas such as corrosion, batteries, fuel cells, biosensors and protective coatings.\n\n\nEquation:\n      An electrochemical impedance (EIS) model with typical equivalent-circuit components is the modified Randles: series resistor Rs, a resistor Rp in parallel with a CPE (Constant Phase Element), and a Warburg element. A common representation for EIS is the Nyquist plot, in which the real axis represents resistance (Zre) and the imaginary axis the negative reactance (−Zim). The formalism involved is in the equation below:\n\\[\nZ_{\\text{total}}(\\omega) = R_s + \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} + Q (j\\omega)^n \\right)^{-1} \\right] + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega}} (1 - j)\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nZ\\(_{total}\\) = total impedance at a given frequency ;\n\\(\\omega\\) = angular frequency (rad/s), \\(\\omega\\)=2πf or \\(\\omega\\)=2πf;\nR\\(_{p}\\) = ohmic resistance (resistance of the electrolyte solution, wires, contacts etc.) ;\nR\\(_{p}\\) = polarization resistance (associated with charge-transfer processes, such as electrochemical reactions);\nQ = constant associated with the constant phase element (CPE), replaces an ideal capacitor to represent non-ideal behaviors ;\nn = CPE exponent, between 0 and 1; defines the degree of ideality of the capacitive behavior (n = 1: ideal capacitor; n &lt; 1: dispersion);\n\\(\\sigma\\) = Warburg coefficient, associated with ion diffusion in the electrochemical system ;\nj = imaginary unit, j\\(^{2}\\) = −1;\n\n      An electrochemical impedance (EIS) model with typical equivalent-circuit components is the modified Randles: series resistor Rs, a resistor Rp in parallel with a CPE (Constant Phase Element), and a Warburg element. A common representation for EIS is the Nyquist plot, in which the real axis represents resistance (Zre) and the imaginary axis the negative reactance (−Zim).\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Check the effect of Rs on the plot, nullifying its value (solution resistance);\n2. Observe the deformation of the semicircle by varying the values of the constant phase element (e.g., Q = 1e-3; n = 0.6 - dispersion of the capacitive behavior); \n2. Try combining other values of the parameters in the code header, to highlight common situations in electroanalysis: Rs, Rp, Q, n, and sigma;\n3. Reduce the Warburg-with-constant-phase-element model to a simple Randles model, formed only by 2 resistors in series, the second in parallel with an ideal capacitor, and without Warburg diffusion (sigma = 0; n = 1).\n\n\n\n\n1.17 Cyclic voltammetry\n\nContext:\n  Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is an electroanalytical technique for characterization of interfacial redox processes (electrode-solution). When a standard analyte in quantitative equilibrium between oxidized and reduced forms is used, the resulting plot acquires an unusual profile, named duck shape. This results from the peculiar format under a bidirectional potentiometric sweep over a set of electrodes by a potentiostat, resulting in oxidation cycles and subsequent reduction (application of positive potentials followed by negative ones). The shape, value and distance between the resulting peaks allow identifying and characterizing the analyte, as well as its redox processes involved in the experiment.\n\n\nEquation:\n  Although the formalism for cyclic voltammetry is complex and involves solving ordinary differential equations (as do electroanalytical techniques in general), being far from the objective of this material, one can summarize the resulting current flow by the Buttler–Volmer equation that follows:\n\\[\nj = j_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F (E - E^0)}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{-(1 - \\alpha) n F (E - E^0)}{RT}\\right) \\right]\n\\] Where:\n\nj = current density;\nj\\(_{0}\\) = exchange current;\n\\(\\alpha\\) = charge transfer coefficient;\nE = potential applied to the electrode;\nE\\(^{0}\\) = standard electrode potential;\nn = number of electrons;\nF = Faraday constant (96485 C·mol⁻¹)\nR = general gas constant (8.314 J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹);\nT = temperature\n\n\n  For a model of diffusion of electroanalyte and accumulation on the electrode surface, the general equation for the boundary condition where the redox conversion rate is proportional to the diffusion current, can be represented by the equation of the 2nd Fick’s law for mass transport:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\partial C(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nC(x,t) = concentration of the electroanalytical species (mol/cm³), as a function of position x and time t;\nD = diffusion coefficient of the species (cm²/s);\nt = time (s);\nx = distance from the electrode surface (cm);\n\\(\\delta\\) = notation for partial derivative.\n\n\n   The chemical equilibrium of the redox reaction is given by the ratio between the concentrations of oxidized and reduced form at the electrode/solution interface when the system is in equilibrium (or near-equilibrium), according to the Nernst equation:\n\\[\nE = E^0 + \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\text{Ox}]}{[\\text{Red}]} \\right)\n\\]\n  The resulting current is obtained by Faraday’s law:\n\\[\ni(t) = n F A D \\left. \\frac{\\partial C(x,t)}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0}\n\\] Where:\n\nA = electrode surface area (cm²);\ni(t) = current at time t (A, Ampere).\n\n\n\nCyclic Voltammetry Simulator\n  To illustrate the potential of the JSPlotly/GSPlotly platform for the development of complex virtual experiments, a cyclic voltammetry simulator follows resulting from the procedures above (as well as from a few hours of prompt engineering!!).\n  The example illustrates a typical behavior in cyclic voltammetry (and the curious duck shape), and includes a diffusion and accumulation modeling of electroactive species near the electrode surface. The code uses a numerical solution to obtain current density over time, considering the effects of cyclic scanning of the applied potential, mass transport, and reaction kinetics.\n  In sum, it numerically solves Fick’s equation with a dynamic boundary condition, applies the Nernst equation at the boundary (electrode surface) to determine conversion between species, uses the finite-difference method or an explicit scheme to advance in time, and obtains the current by applying Faraday’s law, by the derivative of the flux at the interface.\n  Found it complex? Then how about: the code unites Fick (transport) and Nernst (local redox equilibrium) to accurately model the voltammogram shape, obtaining a physical simulation with significant realism for cyclic voltammetry.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Observe the number of values at the beginning of the code, tangible to a \"parametric manipulation\". Try to know what they represent, and try to vary their values consciously, aiming to add value to learning the simulation. This is the soul of \"parametric manipulation\" that involves \"reproducible teaching\" !!\n\n\n\n\n1.18 Diagrams and flowcharts\n\nContext: Diagram\n      By the nature of the Plotly.js library, it is also possible to generate codes in JSPlotly without involving an equation, such as for representing diagrams and flowcharts, among others. The example below illustrates a representation of the Krebs cycle, and the next an experimental flowchart.\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try repositioning enzymes and metabolites better, just by clicking and dragging the terms;\n2. Try replacing the names that are in the code to produce another metabolic cycle, such as the urea cycle.\n\n\n\nContext: Flowchart\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Reposition terms and connectors by mouse dragging;\n2. For a flowchart different in content, modify the terms in the code;\n2. For a flowchart different in format, change the font and connector characteristics in the \"annotations\" constant.",

    "text": "3 Data analysis\n\n3.1 User data entry\n\nContext\n  Sometimes it is useful to work with one’s own discrete data, seeking a trend relationship—mathematical or simply visual—for the relationship between variables. Below is an example of an interactive plot with user data.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing the inserted data, overlaying the plot or not;\n2. Try changing the data representation in \"mode\" and \"type\", to points, lines, points+lines, bars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Loading a file for analysis\n\nContext - CSV file\n  Sometimes, there is a need to analyze results referring to a dataset present in a spreadsheet. For this situation, the following example illustrates loading two data vectors from a CSV (comma separated value) file, a format commonly used for export/import in electronic spreadsheets, and its resulting plot.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1 Click add plot and select a CSV file using the upper browse button that is shown. Note: variable X in the 1st column of the file, and variable Y in the 2nd column;\n\nClick add plot again to view the resulting plot.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try other CSV files;\n2. Vary aspects of the plot, such as type, color, marker size, etc.\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Linear fitting of data\n\nContext:\n  In many situations in experimental research, it is necessary to correlate the data of a dependent variable with a predictor variable, according to the equation below.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\ny = \\alpha x + \\beta + \\varepsilon\n\\]\nWhere:\n\ny = dependent variable;\nx = independent variable;\n\\(\\alpha\\) = slope of the fitted line (slope);\n\\(\\beta\\) = intercept of the fitted line;\n\\(\\epsilon\\) = measurement error.\n\n  The parameters slope and intercept can be obtained by some procedures, such as least squares, matrix algebra, or by simple summations. In the latter case, the computation of parameters and error can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{n \\sum x_i y_i - \\sum x_i \\sum y_i}{n \\sum x_i^2 - \\left( \\sum x_i \\right)^2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{\\sum y_i - \\alpha \\sum x_i}{n}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\hat{y}_i = \\alpha x_i + \\beta\n\\]\n\\[\n\\varepsilon_i = \\left| y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\right|\n\\]\n  A representation for linear fitting with arbitrary data is provided below:\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Show the points overlaid or not with the fitted line. For overlay, choose \"mostrarPontos = true\" and \"mostrarReta = true\";\n2. Change the data and perform a new fit, to obtain other line parameters.\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Polynomial regression\n\nContext:\n  In some situations, the linear fit does not provide an adequate trend for modeling experimental data, which calls for the use of other models, such as exponential, hyperbolic, logarithmic, power, and polynomial. Polynomial trends are common in natural phenomena, with mathematical treatment of the data occurring through different methods, such as simple summations, least squares, or linear algebra. Below is an example of polynomial regression with degrees adjustable in the code.\n\n\n3.4.1 Equation\n  Error minimization for the polynomial curve is obtained by a generalized least-squares regression, and application of the Vandermonde matrix, as follows.\n  Let the vectors x=[x\\(*{1}\\),x\\(*{2}\\),…,x\\(*{n}\\)] and y=[y\\(*{1}\\),y\\(_{2}\\),…,y\\({_n}\\)], and we want to fit the polynomial:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\cdots + \\beta_g x^g\n\\] | Thus, the Vandermonde matrix is built as:\n\\[\nX =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \\cdots & x_1^g \\\\\n1 & x_2 & x_2^2 & \\cdots & x_2^g \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & x_n & x_n^2 & \\cdots & x_n^g\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n  To find the coefficients \\(\\beta\\) that minimize the squared error, the linear system is solved in sequence:\n\\[\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \\mathbf{y}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\nT represents the transpose matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try degree 1 for the polynomial, i.e., reduce the treatment to a linear fit;\n2. Change the formatting of labels, colors, sizes, etc., in the code;\n3. Overlay some fits, edit and reposition the legend;\n4. Test the code with another data vector.\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Multiple linear regression\n\nContext:\n  Multiple linear fitting is very useful when one wants to predict a behavior as a function of two or more predictor variables. The procedure involves a design matrix (or projection operator) similar to the Vandermonde matrix.\n\n\nEquation:\n  The analytical solution for the design matrix involves solving a coefficient matrix \\(\\beta\\) for a set of predictor values of the response vector y, as follows:\n\\[\ny_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{1i} + \\beta_2 x_{2i} + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_{pi} + \\varepsilon_i\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\beta\\) = vector of coefficients;\ny = response vector;\nX = design matrix;\n\\(\\epsilon\\) = random noise\n\n  Thus, predicted values and associated error are obtained by:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{e} = \\mathbf{y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\n\\]\n  Obviously, the graphical representation for a multiple linear fit is limited to two independent variables, x1 and x2, in addition to the response variable (3D plot), although the matrix calculation allows multiple predictor variables (hyperdimensional space). With respect to the first situation, an example follows.\nInstructions\n\nNote that there is a boolean flag (mostrarAjuste) at the beginning of the code: false for data only, and true for the fit;\nYou can click add plot to view the data with the flag set to false, followed by another add plot with the flag set to true.\n\n\n\n\n  Rotate the plot and observe the surface around the points. Unlike a linear fit, the points are distributed non-continuously in space.\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. QSAR (\"Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship\") results use multiple linear fitting analysis to identify the strength of predictor variables. Search online for a dataset that has 2 variables (e.g., concentration, pH, compound A, B, etc.)\n2. For more predictor variables, see the code that follows !!\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Multiple linear fitting with 3 or more predictor variables\n\nContext\n  Although JSPlotly was designed for producing interactive plots and maps using the Plotly.js library on the shoulders of the JavaScript language, it extends the possibilities of application beyond graphical representations. An example of this is the code below, for a multiple linear fit for a situation with 4 predictor variables.\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try varying the number of predictors (xi). To do this:\n  a. If you want to reduce, just remove the desired vector(s), and correct their quantity in the line: \"const X = x1.map((_, i)\";\n  b. If you want to increase, add a new vector in the corresponding line, and update the quantity in the mapping of \"const X = x1.map((_, i)\".\n\n\n\n\n3.7 Response Surface Methodology (RSM)\n\nContext\n  A variation of multiple linear fitting involves response surface methodology, commonly linear (plane) or quadratic (curvilinear), applied in modeling and optimization of experimental processes with multiple independent variables. Its goal is to fit a mathematical equation that represents the relationship between experimental factors and the response variable, allowing prediction of behaviors and identification of optimal conditions.\n  For experiments with two factors, a second-order quadratic model is commonly used, which allows representing surfaces with curvature. The central idea of the experiment is to select values and their codes (-1,0,1), representing, respectively, a quantity below, a medium quantity, and one above, for a given predictor variable.\n\n\nEquation:\n  The general quadratic model for 2 factors is represented by:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_{11} x_1^2 + \\beta_{22} x_2^2 + \\beta_{12} x_1 x_2 + \\varepsilon\n\\]\n  With the matrix form of the model represented by:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n\\]\n  And estimation of the coefficients \\(\\beta\\) by least squares, similarly to multiple linear fitting, by:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As suggested earlier, try using data from the literature or another source whose responses are already known, replacing the respective vectors at the beginning of the code. This allows comparing the effectiveness of using the presented tool.\n\n\n\n\n3.8 Data smoothing - Spline and Savitzky-Golay filter\n      In experimental research, signal detection occasionally occurs in the presence of significant levels of noise, as happens in continuous spectral scanning under variation of wavelength, or in electrical signal detection over time. In this case, there is no analytical equation that describes the behavior of the signal, although some digital processing tools can produce a trend curve in data treatment, significantly reducing the noise level, such as by a spline curve and Savitzky-Golay filter.\n\nContext - Cubic spline\n      A very common interpolation technique refers to using cubic spline by degree-3 polynomials interconnecting data windows. The treatment consists of applying the polynomial functions in subintervals of the points, promoting smoothing between the data windows.\n\n\nEquation\nMathematically, the spline is applied such that:\n\\[\nS_i(x) = a_i + b_i(x - x_i) + c_i(x - x_i)^2 + d_i(x - x_i)^3\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nS\\(_{i}\\)(x) = cubic spline function in the interval [xi,xi+1];\na\\(*{i}\\), b\\(*{i}\\), c\\(*{i}\\), d\\(*{i}\\) = coefficients specific to segment i;\nx\\(_{i}\\) = starting point of the interval;\nx = independent variable.\n\n\n\nContext - Savitzky-Golay filter\n       The Savitzky-Golay smoothing technique applies a local polynomial regression to a moving window, by least squares and a predetermined degree, preserving signals of peaks, valleys, and bands. Unlike cubic spline, the filter produces a global continuous curve, not a set of interconnected curves.\n\n\nEquation\nMathematically:\n\\[\n\\tilde{y}*i = \\sum*{j=-m}^{m} c_j \\cdot y_{i+j}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\ny\\(_{i}\\) = smoothed value at position i;\ny\\(_{i+j}\\) = real series values within the window;\nc\\(_{i}\\) = filter coefficients derived from a polynomial regression;\nm = number of points on each side of the central window.\n\n  Below is an example of code for JSplotly that illustrates the use of both interpolation methods.\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\nThe code has two true/false flags, one for “usarGolay” and another for “usarSpline”;\n\n\nView the raw data adopting false for both flags;\n\n\nTo overlay a cubic spline, change its constant to true;\n\n\nTo overlay the Savitzky-Golay filter, change its constant to true;\n\n\nTo tune the filter, modify its parameters in the constants janela (moving window) and/or grau (polynomial degree).\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Compare the smoothing effects of the two polynomial interpolation treatments;\n2. Apply only the filter, tuning moving-window and polynomial-degree parameters;\n3. Try interpolation with other raw data in the code, replacing the constants \"x_values\" and \"y_raw\" with numeric vectors;\n\n\n\n\n3.9 ANOVA and Tukey-HSD test\n\nContext:\n  In research, it is common to analyze a dataset by comparing the variance between groups with that obtained within each group, i.e., Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Once the statistical information is obtained that there is a difference between groups greater than the internal variance, a post-hoc test is performed for comparison of means, such as the Tukey-HSD (Honest Significant Difference) test.\n\n\nEquation:\n  The equation that characterizes a Tukey-HSD test is provided below (correction for unbalanced groups):\n\\[\n\\text{HSD}*{ij} = q*{\\alpha} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{MS}_{\\text{within}}}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{n_i} + \\frac{1}{n_j} \\right)}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nHSD = minimum value of the difference between two means for it to be considered significant;\nq\\(_{\\alpha}\\) = critical value of the studentized q distribution (Tukey distribution), depending on the number of groups and the significance level \\(\\alpha\\);\nMS\\(_{within}\\) = mean square within groups (error) obtained from ANOVA;\nn: number of observations per group (i and j if there are groups of different sizes).\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. You can click and drag the minimum-difference markers (a,b,etc) above the plot for better visual adjustment, as well as the ANOVA table and the statistical test result;\n2. Change the vector values, redo the analysis and the plot simultaneously, and notice the difference in the obtained values. Note that, as stated on the lower border, it is necessary to refresh the site page to clear previous data retained in cache memory;\n3. Enter other data in the respective vectors, yours or from another source;\n4. Insert new data vectors, or delete one, for a customized calculation and plot.\n\n\n\n\n3.10 Nonlinear fitting of data\n  Modeling is an area of common use in the natural sciences, when one wants prediction or mathematical correlation of experimental data. Models may be linear or nonlinear. When nonlinear, they may be applied empirically to the data (e.g., quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, or power functions), or based on an explanatory mathematical function of the model.\n  In this case, techniques are used for nonlinear fitting of the data to the model, such as Simplex, Gauss, Newton-Raphson, Levenberg-Marquadt, or least squares, for example. Whatever the method, nonlinear fitting differs from linear fitting in assumptions and data treatment (see a quick explanation here.\n\nContext: Ligand-protein interaction (grid search algorithm)\n  The following example illustrates applying a nonlinear fit to molecular interaction data by a Langmuir model, and treating it by minimizing squared error by manual scanning. In this treatment, the sum of squared errors (RMSE) is computed for combinations of a and b, selecting the pair with the lowest computed error. In this case, for simplification, although JSPlotly works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is done by least squares, but performed by grid search, not by classic iterative methods. Thus, a set of values is tested for the pair (a, b) on a previously defined grid (combination table), allowing identification of the parameters that best describe the experimental data according to the minimum-error criterion.\n\n\n\n\nEquation:\n  The Langmuir equation is represented below:\n\\[\nY = \\frac{aX}{K_d + X}\n\\] Where:\n\nY = fraction of occupied sites;\nX = concentration of free ligand;\na = saturation value (sites of the same affinity fully occupied);\nKd = equilibrium dissociation constant of the complex.\n\n  In this case, the nonlinear least-squares function is:\n\\[\nSSR(a, K_d) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\frac{a x_i}{K_d + x_i} \\right)^2\n\\]\nWhere:\nSSR = sum of squared residuals (inversely proportional to fit quality)\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As in the previous example, alternatively show the points and the fitted curve using the boolean operation (\"mostrarPontos = true/false\"; \"mostrarCurva = true/false\");\n2. Change the data and perform a new fit, to obtain other equation parameters (Kd, SSR, R², adjusted R²). Note: adjusted R² corresponds to the R² value corrected for the number of model parameters (in this case, \"2\"), directly affecting the \"degrees of freedom\" for the fit.\n\n\n\n\n\nContext - Competitive inhibition in enzyme kinetics (Gauss-Newton algorithm)\n  The Gauss-Newton method iteratively fits nonlinear models to experimental datasets. It is especially efficient when the model is almost linear with respect to the parameters and the residuals are moderately small. The goal is to find the parameters \\(\\theta\\) that minimize the sum of squared residuals between the observed data yi and the predicted values by the model f(xi,\\(\\theta\\). Unlike the full Newton-Raphson method, Gauss-Newton avoids explicit calculation of the Hessian, using an approximation based on the Jacobian of the residuals.\n\n\nEquation:\n  This approximation results in a linear system that can be solved at each iteration to update the model parameters. The central formula of the method consists of multiplying the transposed Jacobian JT by the Jacobian itself J, forming a symmetric matrix that approximates the Hessian. The residual vector r is then used to determine the update direction \\(\\Delta\\theta\\), with the following equation:\n\\[\n\\theta_{k+1} = \\theta_k + \\left(J^T J\\right)^{-1} J^T \\cdot r\n\\]\n  To illustrate the potential of the app in iterative nonlinear fitting, an example follows for enzyme kinetics using a competitive inhibition model.\n  The code allows fitting the seeds, tolerance, and number of iterations, and provides the plot (points/fitted line, manually), and statistical regression parameters.\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\nNotice that the code has a true/false flag in the constant ajuste. Leave it false for representing the data only (vectors x and y, or S and v);\n\n\nIn the code’s Plot area, set the constant trace so that it uses the data vectors as well;\n\n\nClick add plot to view the experimental points;\n\n\nTo overlay the fitted curve, update the constants ajuste and trace (vectors S_fit and v_fit), and choose lines in mode.",

    "text": "4 Applications\n\n4.1 prot.Id - Simulated experimentation for characterization of amino acids and chains\n\nContext:\n  JSPlotly makes it possible to work with a set of interactions not necessarily tied to equations and their graphical representations. The example below illustrates its potential for simulating a classic Biochemistry experiment: the characterization of amino acids, peptides, and proteins through chromogenic reactions in test tubes. Since the scope of this material is to present and enable the use of varied OIERs (interactive objects for reproducible teaching), users are encouraged to seek information sources related to the reactions briefly described below.\n\n\nSimulator instructions\n  The simulator offers two options: a) discover the nature of a sample or b) discover the reaction color pattern for a selected sample.\n\n\nOption A: discovering the nature of a sample:\n  Here it is possible to “play” to check whether you are facing a protein/peptide (chain) sample, an amino acid (AA), a specific mixture of AAs, or AA(s) present in a chain. To do that:\n\nClick the image below and press “add”. A set of 7 colored bars will be generated, representing the colors obtained in test tubes for 7 distinct reactions used for protein characterization: ninhydrin, biuret, Pauly, xanthoproteic, Sakaguchi, Millon, and sulfur (Cys);\nDetermine the sample type based on the color pattern presented, making a guess. The guess must be by type (in the “Guess (type)” menu—AA, chain, or AA mixture) and by profile (in the “Guess (profile)” menu—random, specific AA(s) or specific mixture);\nAfter selecting both menus, click “Check”. If correct, a “Scoreboard” right below will count the number of correct guesses/number of samples “played”;\nIf you miss, try again or look for the explanation of the color pattern in “Explain”;\n\n\nThere are two other possibilities: “Hard mode”, which hides the reaction names while keeping their sequence, and “Shuffle”, which changes the order of the tubes;\nFor a new sample, just click “New sample”;\n\nOption B: discovering the reaction color pattern for a selected sample:\n\nSelect a sample in “Generate”, and click “New sample”. A set of tubes will be generated with the expected reaction pattern for that sample.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try clicking \"New sample\" to see how often possibilities occur;\n2. Try both operating options of the \"game\" (yes, it is a game...after all, it has a scoreboard!);\n3. Try \"hard mode\" (without reaction labels in sequence) or \"shuffle\" (permutes the reaction order). Obviously, however, avoid using both at the same time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 ZeMol - 3D viewer for molecular models\n\nContext:\n  Due to the combined characteristics of using JavaScript and the Plotly.js library, it is possible to extend the potential applications of JSPlotly to the construction of true HTML applications. A clear example of this reach is shown below: a molecular viewer similar in nature to some pre-existing tools used in teaching and research (Jmol, Pymol, etc.).\n  Although it is obviously much smaller in functionality compared to other applications, the so-called “ZeMol” uses less than 70 kB of memory and provides features such as:\n\nmodels loaded online from the PDB or PubChem sites;\nmodels loaded from the device’s physical storage (PDB, MOL, SDF, XYZ, TXT formats);\nidentification information for the PDB file (or PubChem file name);\nheader containing counts of chains, ligands, ions, and disulfide bonds;\nidentification of only the \\(\\alpha\\) carbons of each residue in the polypeptide backbone, facilitating model visualization;\nautomatic visualization of disulfide bonds;\nidentification of residues, ligands, and ions by mouse hover over the model;\ncheckbox to show protein secondary structure (helix, \\(\\beta\\)-sheet);\ncheckbox for residue polarity index;\nsliders for CA carbon size (PDB) or atoms in general, and model opacity (useful to highlight clefts, secondary structure, carbon chain, ligands, ions);\nhide/show distinct parts of the model by clicking its legend (chain, ions, helices/sheets, ligands);\nhighlighting amino acids (single, range, all of one type, predefined groups in the script);\nself-contained HTML when saving, “freezing” the model in the characteristics you want to present;\nZoom on mobile devices (one finger fixed on the screen and another dragging the model) and Pan (moving the model with two fingers on the screen)—actions also present in the icons above the model;\noptional adjustments in the script itself (sizes, colors, thicknesses, AA groups, line type and thickness, for example).\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Load a model with a PDB code, or a molecule from the PubChem site;\n2. If it is a protein, try the separate and combined effects of the sliders for CA size and opacity;\n3. Observe residue polarity in the polarity checkbox;\n4. Try zooming in/out or moving it on the screen with the mouse, or doing it on a smartphone as instructed above; \n5. Show or hide each chain or all chains, ligands, and ions by clicking the corresponding legend terms;\n6. Select residues of interest in the model, such as a catalytic site, coenzyme-binding site, or regulatory residues. To do this, type in the corresponding field and click \"highlight\". Some suggestions:\n  a. Single: Arg15, ASP117, 15, A:15, A:ARG15; \n  b. Ranges: 15-30, A:15-30, Arg15-Asp30; \n  c. Multiple separated by commas: \"Arg15, Asp117\";\n  d. Groups: \"aromatico\", \"polar\", \"apolar\", \"basico\", \"acido\", \"small\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 carbo.Id - Simulated experimentation for carbohydrate characterization\n\nContext:\n  As presented for amino acid and chain characterization above, here is a simulated experimentation for carbohydrate characterization. The logic is the same: given the chromogenic results for specific reactions in test tubes (bar chart), the user tries to characterize the carbohydrate. This is done with respect to the reactions of:\n\nMolisch test – detects carbohydrates (purple ring); reaction with \\(\\alpha\\)-naphthol producing furfural or hydroxymethylfurfural;\nLugol test (I\\(_{2}\\)/KI) – detects polysaccharides (dark blue tube);\nBenedict test – detects reducing monosaccharides (and also lactose); tube with dark orange/brick precipitate;\nSeliwanoff test (resorcinol) – differentiates ketoses (red tube) from aldoses (faint pink tube);\nBarfoed test – differentiates mono (tube with red precipitate – cuprous oxide) from oligosaccharides (yellowish tube).\n\n\n\nSimulator instructions\nOption A: discovering the nature of a sample:\n  To discover the nature of a sample, proceed as in the amino acid and chain characterization app above. To do that:\n\nClick the image below and press “add”. A set of 5 colored bars will be generated, representing the colors obtained in test tubes for the 5 distinct reactions used for carbohydrate characterization: Molisch, Lugol, Benedict, Seliwanoff, and Barfoed.\nDetermine the sample type based on the tube color pattern presented, making a guess. The guess must be by type (in the “Guess (type)” menu—monosaccharide, di-oligosaccharide, polysaccharide, water) and by profile (in the “Guess (profile)” menu—reducing, non-reducing, aldose, ketose, monosaccharide, di-oligosaccharide, and polysaccharide);\nAfter selecting both menus, click “Check”. If correct, a “Scoreboard” right below will count the number of correct guesses/number of samples “played”;\nIf you miss, try again or look for the explanation of the color pattern in “Explain”;\n\n\nThere are two other possibilities: “Hard mode”, which hides the reaction names while keeping their sequence, and “Shuffle”, which changes the order of the tubes;\nFor a new sample, just click “New sample”;\n\nOption B: discovering the reaction color pattern for a selected sample:\n\nSelect a sample in “Generate”, and click “New sample”. A set of tubes will be generated with the expected reaction pattern for that sample.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try clicking \"New sample\" to see how often possibilities occur;\n2. Try both operating options of the \"simulator/app/game\");\n3. Try \"hard mode\" (without reaction labels in sequence) or \"shuffle\" (permutes the reaction order). Obviously, however, avoid using both at the same time!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 FlowForces\n\nContext:\n  The name above alludes to the Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine and self-organizing processes, such as those found in living cells. In this case, the quantities of certain reactants and products configure the forces, while their transformations point to the flows.\n  With respect to both, it is sometimes interesting to study the effect of a modifier, such as an activator or inhibitor, in a metabolic pathway or any biochemical reaction—both in isolation and in an organelle, cell, or even the organism. In this sense, the application simulates such effects in a biological system where the user enters metabolites into a continuous logging flow for an arbitrary signal.\n  For example, the addition of metabolic modifiers to a cell suspension can be monitored by the oxygen level of the sample, as measured by an oxygraph, and simulated below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing one or more compounds with biochemical justification, for example for a metabolic pathway;\n2. Test variations of \"delay\" for the appearance of a modifier effect by clicking the \"Advanced\" checkbox;\n3. Try increasing the noise in \"const noise\", raising it 100x:\n    \"const noise = noiseOn ? (Math.random()-0.5)*20\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Gizz - Digital chalkboard\n\nContext:\n  The nature of the object below needs no introduction. It is yet another among many applications that simulate a chalkboard or digital whiteboard. Unlike its competitors, however:\n\nIt can be exported as a self-contained HTML file via a button on the board itself, allowing sharing of the generated image and continued editing;\nIt allows customization of the code that produces it, making it possible to insert/change pens, thicknesses, and different actions not provided in the source code.\n\n\n\n\n  In terms of its features, the digital board allows:\n\nWriting with 7 colors and 3 different thicknesses;\nAccessing 4 background planes with different coloration;\nOverlaying the background with a grid;\nUsing an eraser (erase);\nUsing a laser pointer to transiently locate what you want to point out;\nSaving the image as PNG, indicating date and time;\nCommands for undo (undo) and cleaning (clean) the board;\nKeyboard shortcuts: E=eraser; L=laser; Z undo, X clear, H save HTML\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. You can change pen thickness in \"var baseWidth = 1;\" ;\n2. The 1x, 2x, 4x buttons are multipliers; edit the button creation lines to change label/multiplier (e.g., \"addSize('3x', 3, true)\").",

    "text": "5 Toolkits\n  JSPlotly can operate as a complete application for simulation in varied situations. The “toolboxes” below illustrate interactive panels (dashboards) for simulated experimentation and analysis in biophysical chemistry, focusing on themes of kinetics, interaction, and stability for protein targets. Each toolkit allows an appreciation of methods used, applications, modeling, and parameter interpretation. As a whole, the toolkits enable an integrated study of kinetics and thermodynamics for application in biotechnology, biocatalysis, and drug discovery.\nImportant notes:\n\nThe Toolkits contain internal code for styles and panel assembly that can interfere with the Bootstrap of the web page builder used for Bioquanti (the Quarto package for R). In this sense, the clickable images for each panel point to the individual scripts for loading each Toolkit into JSPlotly.\nEach panel is displayed below the JSPlotly plotting screen. This is necessary to maximize the area available for displaying the panels.\n\n\nIndividually, the toolkits include:\n\nEK-Toolkit - modeling in enzyme kinetics and inhibition;\nLeadHunt - lead-compound prospecting via enzyme inhibition;\nLB-Toolkit - analysis of ligand–protein interaction;\nGH-Toolkit - thermodynamic stability of biopolymers;\nmTherm-Toolkit - stability under perturbing conditions;\nThermStab-Toolkit - enzyme thermostability;\nBiocel-Toolkit - microbial fuel cell performance\n\n\n5.1 EK-Toolkit\nGeneral instructions\n  The EK-Toolkit is a toolbox for simulating enzyme kinetics and inhibition using diagnostic plots. The kit generates three graphs side by side:\n\nMichaelis–Menten: v × [S];\nLineweaver–Burk (LB) — 1/v vs 1/[S];\nReplot - LB slope or intercept, or Dixon ordinate (1/v)\n\n  Additional features include HTML export, CSV export and load, editable annotations, draggable windows, and model comparison (A/B).\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\nModels: Michaelis–Menten; Substrate excess; Irreversible inhibition; Competitive inhibition; Non-competitive inhibition (pure); Mixed inhibition; Uncompetitive inhibition; Bi-substrate (Random Sequential, Ordered Sequential, Ping-Pong); Hill (cooperativity); Enzyme activation (Vmax-up); User (free equation);\nSynchronized plots: v×[S], LB (1/v vs 1/[S]) and Replot (slope, intercept or Dixon 1/v vs modifier);\nA/B comparison with consistent color palettes across plots;\nPanels: models, equations, parameters (range of [S], number of simulated points, error, modifiers, parameters;\nConfigurable Replot with editable X-axis label.\nFits: weighted linear fit in LB and replots - WLS (weighted least squares, weight: 1/y²); OLS (ordinary least squares) in Dixon.\nKi estimation in Dixon; vertical marker at (x = -K_i).\nHTML export with interactive plots and equations; PT-BR CSV (‘;’ separator, ‘,’ decimal).\nCSV load to reconstruct plots and diagnostics; ‘Clear CSV’ to return to simulation.\nDraggable modals; clickable/editable annotations; global legend ON/OFF.\n\n\n\nModels\nMichaelis–Menten \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max} S}{K_m + S} \\]\nSubstrate excess \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max} S}{K_m + S + \\dfrac{S^2}{K_{is}}} \\]\nIrreversible inhibition \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max}(1-f) S}{K_m + S} \\]\nCompetitive \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max} S}{K_m \\left(1 + \\dfrac{I}{K_i}\\right) + S} \\]\nNon-competitive (pure) \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max}}{1 + \\dfrac{I}{K_i}} \\cdot \\dfrac{S}{K_m + S} \\]\nMixed \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max}}{1 + \\dfrac{I}{K_{i2}}} \\cdot \\dfrac{S}{K_m \\left(1 + \\dfrac{I}{K_{i1}}\\right) + S} \\]\nUncompetitive \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max} S}{K_m + S\\left(1 + \\dfrac{I}{K_i}\\right)} \\]\nBiBi Random Sequential \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max} A B}{K_a K_b + K_a B + K_b A + A B} \\]\nBiBi Ordered Sequential \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max} A B}{K_a K_b + K_b A + A B} \\]\nBiBi Ping-Pong \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max} A B}{K_b A + K_a B + A B} \\]\nHill (cooperativity) \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max} S^n}{K^n + S^n} \\]\nActivator (Vmax-up) \\[ v = \\dfrac{V_{max}\\left(1 + \\dfrac{A}{K_{aA}}\\right) S}{K_m + S} \\]\nNote:\n\na (intercept): value of 1/v when 1/[S] = 0.\nb (slope): LB line slope = (K_m/V_{max}).\nK_i: inhibition constant (Dixon: (x = -K_i)).\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1.

Also LE &gt;= 0.3; LLE &gt;= 5.\n  The inhibitor dose–response curve also allows determination of:\n\nIC\\(_{50}\\), inhibitor concentration giving 50% response (adequate when &lt; 10\\(\\mu\\)M);\nnH, Hill constant (midpoint slope; cooperativity index)\n\n\n\n\nUsing LeadHunt to identify a lead compound\n  From the visualization of plots and descriptors of the fictional molecule, it is possible to determine:\n\nThe type of reversible inhibition (competitive, uncompetitive, pure non-competitive, mixed non-competitive);\nThe Ki value by constructing various secondary plots from the parameter-entry table (Ki table)—plot inhibitor concentration I versus apparent Km, Vmax, or Km/Vm. Alternatively, plot I against (\\(\\alpha\\)-1), where \\(\\alpha\\) represents “1+I/Ki”;\nThe IC\\(_{50}\\) value and nH (midpoint slope) from the dose–response curve (cooperativity estimate);\nThe \\(\\Delta\\)H and \\(\\Delta\\)S values from the van’t Hoff plot. If the plot is curvilinear, also the \\(\\Delta\\)Cp value;\nThe LE and LLE values;\nEvaluate the candidate against Lipinski’s rules.\n\n  Thus, LeadHunt can be used for a meaningful simulation of screening an inhibitor as a lead compound for an enzyme target.\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Compare enzyme inhibition types by visual inspection of the Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk plots, emphasizing whether \"Km\" and \"Vmax\" do or do not change between them;\n\n2. Compute \"Ki\" by different methods using the field for \"replot\" by inhibitor level (table of \"Apparent parameters\"):\n    a) by obtaining \"1/Ki\" from the I x (alpha-1) plot (line slope) via the \"alpha-replot\" button;\n  b) by intercept \"-Ki\" from plots of I x Vmax_app, Km_app, or Km/Vm_app (depending on the inhibition model);\n  c) by \"slope\" or \"intercept\" from replots of Lineweaver–Burk against I\n\n3. Try the \"parameters\" mode with an \"nH\" value different from 1 (e.g., 2.8) to evaluate dose–response curve behavior under cooperativity effects;\n\n4. Try the \"parameters\" mode with a non-zero heat capacity value (e.g., -2000) to evaluate the possibility of secondary binding effects as a function of temperature, such as enzyme conformational transition;\n\n5. Test curvature of the van’t Hoff plot for a heat-capacity change by providing positive (e.g., 2000) and negative values (e.g., -2000): if concave up, negative heat-capacity change; if concave down, positive heat-capacity change.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nMarangoni, Alejandro G.

It allows visualization and fitting of classic binding curves (Binding, Scatchard, Benesi–Hildebrand, and Hill), and supports interactive HTML export of data and plots.\n\nFeatures\n  The LB-Toolkit enables study and graphical visualization of a 2 × 2 panel representing classic bimolecular interaction models: Langmuir, Hill (positive and negative cooperativity), site heterogeneity (two-site), and conformational transition (R/T). HTML export is self-contained, and CSV import/export uses L,v vectors.\n  The main functions of the top bar are: RESET (restore default values), HTML (export standalone viewer), DIAGNOSTIC (show model summary), PARAMETERS (open control panel), EQUATIONS (show formulas), and CSV/LOAD (export or import data as L,v.\n\nAdjustable parameters\n\nn, Kd, nH, sigma error, points, Lmin, Lmax\nTwo-site: n1, n2, Kd1, Kd2\nConformational (R/T): Kt, KdR, KdT\nToggles: draw model only, results below, Hill 10–90%, zoom sliders, autoplot\n\n\n\nModels\nLangmuir\n\\[\nv = n,\\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n\\]\n\nHill\n\\[\nv = n,\\frac{[L]^{n_H}}{K_d^{n_H} + [L]^{n_H}}\n\\]\nLinearization:\n\\[\n\\log!\\left(\\frac{v}{n - v}\\right) = n_H \\log[L] - n_H \\log K_d\n\\]\n\nTwo-site (site heterogeneity)\n\\[\nv = n_1,\\frac{[L]}{K_{d1} + [L]} + n_2,\\frac{[L]}{K_{d2} + [L]}\n\\]\n\nConformational (R/T)\n\\[\nv = n,\\frac{L/K_{dR} + K_t L/K_{dT}}{1 + L/K_{dR} + K_t(1 + L/K_{dT})}\n\\]\n\n\nClassic linearizations\n\n\n  Fits are displayed as smooth spline lines, because polynomial regression parameters do not have direct physical meaning.\nScatchard\n\\[\n\\frac{v}{[L]} = \\frac{n}{K_d} - \\frac{1}{K_d} v\n\\]\n\nBenesi–Hildebrand\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v} = a,\\frac{1}{[L]} + b\n\\]\n\n\n\nFits and estimates\n\nBinding (n,Kd): non-linear fit (Gauss–Newton).\nScatchard and Benesi: illustrative spline interpolation.\nHill: linear regression on the 10–90% range.\n\n\n5.3.0.1 Plots\n\nBinding: v vs [L] – theoretical curve + experimental points.\nScatchard: v/L vs v – spline line fit to data.\nBenesi–Hildebrand: 1/[L] vs 1/v – illustrative spline.\nHill: log(v/(n–v)) vs log[L] – linear regression with display of nH and Kd.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Use the slider (zoom bar) to enlarge/reduce the plots;\n2. Try customizing the graphical representations. For example, click the \"Parameters\" button and change the model to negative cooperativity with two sites, assigning distinct values to them (optional).\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCarey, Jannette.

It includes useful forms for simulation from parameters at (T_0) or at (T_m), as well as diagnostic linearizations for direct parameter reading.\n  The simulator lets you work with fundamental equations (forms in (T_0) and centered at (T_m)) with constant (ΔC_p) and a linear-variation variant. Interpretation of the fits (regressions) is shown graphically from the selected Parameters. It also includes some Scenarios (mesophile, psychrophile, thermophile) and Presets for thermodynamic quantities. The app can simulate (ΔG(T)) directly from ((T_m,,ΔH_m,,ΔC_p)), and exports plots and data (CSV/HTML) in selectable units (kJ/mol ↔︎ kcal/mol; J/mol/K ↔︎ cal/mol/K).\n\n\n\n\nParameters\n1. Reference form at (T_0) (integrals with constant (ΔC_p))\nEnthalpy \\[\nΔH(T)=ΔH^\\circ + ΔC_p,(T-T_0)\n\\]\nEntropy \\[\nΔS(T)=ΔS^\\circ + ΔC_p\\ln!\\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)\n\\]\nGibbs energy (integrated Gibbs–Helmholtz) \\[\nΔG(T)=ΔH^\\circ - T,ΔS^\\circ + ΔC_p\\Big[(T-T_0)-T\\ln!\\left(\\frac{T}{T_0}\\right)\\Big]\n\\]\nEquilibrium constant \\[\n\\ln K(T)= -\\frac{ΔG(T)}{R,T}\n\\]\n2. Form centered at (T_m) (stability curve via (ΔH_m) and (ΔC_p))\nThis form is convenient when the equilibrium temperature (T_m) (where (ΔG=0)), the enthalpy change at (T_m) ((ΔH_m)), and (ΔC_p) are known:\n\\[\nΔG(T)=ΔH_m!\\left(1-\\frac{T}{T_m}\\right) + ΔC_p\\Big[(T-T_m)-T\\ln!\\left(\\frac{T}{T_m}\\right)\\Big].\n\\]\n  From this expression it is possible to recover parameters at (T_0) consistent with the curve:\n\\[\\begin{aligned}\nΔH^\\circ(T_0) &= ΔH_m + ΔC_p,(T_0-T_m),[4pt]\nΔS^\\circ(T_0) &= \\frac{ΔH_m}{T_m} + ΔC_p\\ln!\\left(\\frac{T_0}{T_m}\\right).\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nIn the app, the button “generate by Eq. (T_m)” applies these relations.\n3. Heat capacity with linear variation (term (ΔΔC_p))\n  To explore small linear variations of heat capacity around a reference (T_r):\n\\[\nC_p(T)=C_{p,r}+ΔΔC_p,(T-T_r).\n\\]\nIn the app, checking “Compare two proteins (use (ΔΔC_p)” plots protein B with (ΔC_{p,B}=ΔC_{p,A}+ΔΔC_p) and shows the consequence on the curvature of (ΔG(T)) and the shift of (T_m).\n\n\nScenarios\n  The Scenario chooses the nature of the modeled process and initializes coherent signs and magnitudes:\n\nExothermic folding: (ΔH^&lt;0); enthalpy-dominant stabilization at (T_0).\nEndothermic folding: (ΔH^&gt;0) and (ΔS^&gt;0) (entropy gain compensates).\nUnfolding: inverts folding signs.\nExothermic / endothermic binding: typical settings for ligand–receptor interaction.\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Note: T_m occurs when ΔG=0. In that case, a dashed vertical line is shown in the ΔG x T plot;\n2. Choose a didactic \"Preset\" and compare its effect on stability curves:\n  - None: coherent random draw.\n  - term ↑ΔG global: makes ΔS more negative (raises ΔG globally).\n  - term ↓ΔC_p: flattens curvature in ΔG(T).\n  - psychro ↑ΔC_p: accentuates curvature.\n  - binder ΔC_p&lt;0: uses negative ΔC_p (cases of reduced hydrophobic binding etc.).\n3. Curvature of ΔG(T) grows with |ΔC_p|; thus, compare A vs B, and see the difference in the graphical profile (\"shape\") and T_m shift;\n4. Note that:\n  - the van’t Hoff representation recovers ΔH and ΔS (when ΔC_p = 0).\n  - slopes/intercepts serve as consistency checks between plots\n  - from ΔH x T: slope gives ΔC_p.\n  - from ΔS x ln T: slope gives ΔC_p, and intercept is compatible with ΔS and T_0.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAtkins, Peter William, et al. Physical chemistry for the life sciences.

Data are plotted as a function of an experimental signal (absorbance/fluorescence), followed by the calculation of conformational fractions and effective Gibbs energy as a function of denaturant. The simulator also allows comparison between proteins or experimental conditions (A/B).\n  The app uses a two-state model between a “native” set (F) and a “denatured” set (U). The denaturant effect is linear on the standard free energy of the monomer (LEA – Linear Extrapolation Assumption). To simulate an osmolyte effect (stabilizing or not), an empirical multiplicative term is applied to the slope (m).\n\n\n\n\n\n  In addition, the simulator allows export of interactive figures and diagnostics (HTML), CSV export of denaturant, signal, and energy data together with diagnostics, as well as JSON interface presets for scenarios (save/load).\n\nParameters\nStandard free energy vs. ([D]) — monomer (LEA)\n\\[\n\\Delta G^\\circ(D)=\\Delta G^\\circ(\\mathrm{H_2O})-m,D\n\\tag{2.1}\n\\]\nMultimer (F_n nU) — mass action (solve (f_U))\n\\[\n\\Delta G^\\circ + RT\\ln!\\left(\\frac{n,f_U^{,n}}{P_t^{,n-1}(1-f_U)}\\right)=0\n\\tag{2.2}\n\\]\n\n\n(n): number of monomers in (F_n);\n(P_t): monomer-equivalent concentration (in M);\nEq.

The simulator allows observation of the effect of compatible osmolytes (e.g., glycine, sorbitol, sucrose, betaine) on the resulting plots. In the app, a simple empirical effect is modeled as a scaling of the slope:\n\\[\nm_{\\mathrm{eff}} = m ,\\bigl(1 + k_{\\mathrm{osm}},[\\mathrm{osm}]\\bigr)\n\\tag{6.1}\n\\]\nwhere (k_{}) is an adjustable strength parameter (typically 0.05–0.2 M\\(^{-1}\\)).

Its goal is to help understand the physical and thermodynamic performance of a fuel cell (MFC, or a simple battery) from the relationships between voltage, current, power, and the cell’s internal resistance.\n  The simulator also includes the impact of biochemical modifiers and experimental variations such as biofilm maturation, substrate depletion, and overshooting observed under real operating conditions.\n\n\n\n  As with the previous toolkits, part of the simulator’s interactivity allows exporting and reimporting experimental data (CSV/JSON), generating a self-contained file with interactive plots and diagnostics (Save HTML), and reinitializing to a new configuration (Reset).\n\n\n\nParameters\nThevenin model\n  The equivalent circuit of the microbial cell is modeled as a voltage source (E_{OCV}) (open-circuit voltage) associated with an internal resistance (R_{int}) and an external resistance (R_{ext}), according to Thevenin’s theorem.\nCurrent (I) and the voltage across the load resistor (V) are given by:\n\\[\nI = \\frac{E_{OCV}}{R_{int} + R_{ext}}, \\qquad\nV = I , R_{ext}\n\\]\n\nElectrical power and maximum condition\n  The instantaneous power dissipated in the load is:\n\\[\nP = E_{OCV} , I - R_{int} I^2\n\\]\n\n  Substituting (I) from the Thevenin model:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{E_{OCV}^2 , R_{ext}}{(R_{int} + R_{ext})^2}\n\\]\n\nThe maximum power point occurs when (R_{ext} = R_{int}), known as the Jacobi condition, yielding:\n\\[\nP_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{E_{OCV}^2}{4 R_{int}}\n\\]\n\nActivation and concentration overpotentials\n  To represent electrochemical activation and mass-transport phenomena, the observed potential (V_{pol}) is reduced by two loss terms:\n\\[\nV_{pol} = V_{lin} - \\eta_{act} - \\eta_{conc}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\\[\n\\eta_{act} = A \\ln!\\big(1 + \\frac{I}{I_0}\\big), \\qquad\n\\eta_{conc} = C , \\frac{(I/I_{lim})^2}{1 - I/I_{lim}}\n\\]\n\n  These relations simulate voltage drops associated with electrochemical kinetics and limitations in transport of ions and substrates.\nTime dynamics\n  During operation, the cell shows changes in potential and internal resistance over time, represented by:\n\\[\nE_{OCV}(t) = E_{\\max}\\big(1 - e^{-k_{act}t}\\big) s(f)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nR_{int}(t) = R_0 \\big(1 + \\beta (1 - f)\\big)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\\[\ns(f) = 0.40 + 0.60f, \\quad f = \\frac{Q}{Q_{theor}}\n\\]\n  These functions describe progressive biofilm activation and resistive modulation due to substrate depletion.\n\n\nCharges and efficiencies\n  The theoretical charge available in the biocell is:\n\\[\nQ_{theor} = n_{\\text{gluc}} , n_e , F\n\\]\n\nWhere: (F) is Faraday’s constant and (n_e = 24) is the number of electrons per mole of glucose.\n  Charge efficiency ((_Q)) and energy efficiency ((_E)) are:\n\\[\n\\eta_Q = 100 \\times \\frac{\\int I,dt}{Q_{theor}} \\quad [%]\n\\]\n\\[\n\\eta_E = 100 \\times \\frac{\\int IV,dt}{Q_{theor} E_{\\max}} \\quad [%]\n\\]\n\n\nInterface and features\nThe BioFuelCell interface is divided into three plot panels and a parameter section:\n\nTime × Potential (t × V) — shows output potential evolution over time for each external resistor;\nPolarization curve (V × I) — shows voltage decay as a function of current, with or without overpotentials;\nPower curve (I × P) — computes power dissipated in the load and highlights the maximum power point.\n\n  Below the plots, automatically calculated parameters are displayed:\n\n(R_{int,lin}) — internal resistance by linear fit of the real curve;\n(R_{int,ideal}) — theoretical internal resistance (Thevenin model);\n(P_{}) and (R_{P}) — maximum power and corresponding resistance;\n(_Q) and (_E) — charge and energy efficiencies.\n\n\n\n5.7.1 Parameters and modifiers\n  The user can adjust:\n\nResistor range — minimum and maximum (R_{ext}) (in Ω), distributed logarithmically;\nModifier intensity — from 0% to 300%;\nLog scale for power — toggles current axis to log scale;\nExperimental presets — predefined simulated operating conditions.\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Observe the intersection point between the polarization curve and the ideal parabola. This point indicates the balance between electron supply and consumption;\n2. Note the initial slope of the V×I curve, which represents the internal resistance (R_int) of the biocell;\n3. Check the system’s internal efficiency by observing the position of the peak in the power plot;\n4. Try some of the experimental \"Presets\" (mature biofilm, substrate excess, etc.) and evaluate how conditions affect the electrochemical performance shown in plots and results.\n\nThe potential vs time plot should appear.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nLogan, B.

    "text": "5 Some recommendations for typing in an R script:\nThere are some basic assumptions for an R script to be read clearly by its developer, as well as compiled correctly by the program:\n\nTyping: whenever there is an error in the script in Rstudio, a red cross will appear on the left side of the command line; once the error is corrected, the sign disappears;\nComments: so that the script can also be read by a human being, it is advisable to add comments to the command lines (starting with #) - one of the basics of Reproducible Teaching;\nIndentation: allow “indentation” when the line is a little long by clicking the Enter key after a separation of arguments by “comma”. This way, the line continues just below, but with a small shift to the right. This makes the code easier to read.\nNames: R commands are in English. Therefore, you should avoid using variables and file names with accents or graphic symbols in Portuguese (e.g., ç, ~). In addition, R is a code compiler. If you define a compound name for a file or variable, i.e., with a space between the terms (as is normal in everyday language, e.g., my file), R will try to execute the terms separately (e.g., “my” and then “file”), which will cause the reading to be interrupted and an error message to appear. Therefore, for variable and file names, give preference to one of the three types of common conventions used in programming, namely:\n\n\nseparation by underline, ” _ “ or hyphen; e.g.: my_variable, my-variable\nseparation by capital letters; e.g.: myVariable\nseparation by dots; e.g.: my.variable"

And many others that your imagination and technical rigor allow you to study.\nIn these cases, it is interesting to know and apply a few animation commands explained below. The examples have been selected to simplify each command. But don’t be fooled by the capabilities of Jmol, because for each command there are always several complementary options. And if you want to know anything about any Jmol command, visit the reference website.\n\n1.1 Spin\nSimple command to rotate the molecule.\n\nload $glucose; spin 30 # the value refers to the rotation speed\n\n\n\n1.2 ZoomTo (resize)\nThis command is impressive because it allows for controlled magnification or reduction over time. Its syntax is:\n\n*zoomTo* : time (optional expression) size\n\nExamples:\n\nIncrease by 3x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 *3 \n\nIncrease by 4x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 400\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand with 2x magnification: zoomto 2(ligand) 0\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand with 4x magnification, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5(ligand)* 4\n\n\n\n1.3 Delay\nThis is a key command for any animation, as it allows the image of the molecule in Jmol to pause (in seconds) before the next action. It is normally used in the sequence of commands by the Console throughout a script.\n\ndelay 3 # waits 3 seconds before the next action\n\nWe can try out an animation with the above commands using the cyclohexanol model.\n\n\n\nCyclohexanol structure.

Right click on the screen -&gt; File -&gt; Save -&gt; Save as PNG/JMOL # by mouse\nor...\n2. write molecule_name.pngj # by command line in the Console\n\nOne of the impressive features of Jmol is that by saving the molecule as PNG/JMOL, you can open the file as a static image with a double click to just show the molecule, or drag the file to the Jmol window in your browser, which will load the three-dimensional and interactive structure of the model!!! \n\n\n\nNow it’s up to you:\n\nLoad a model for “phenol” by typing in the Console: load $phenol\nSave the model by typing in the Console: `write phenol.pngj\nChange the orientation of the model randomly with the mouse (just move it a little);\nLocate the file phenol.pngj on your computer;\nOpen it as a normal image, just to test;\nNow drag the file to the Jmol online window and see if the model replaces the previous one (just check the orientation)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1 Some movements in Jmol\nTo illustrate some actions, we will initially use the vitamin C model, loading it with the command below in the Console.\n\nload $ascorbate"

Thus, Jmol can render the model as stick, wireframe, filled space, ball and stick, trace, and cartoon (all in English, of course - cpk, wireframe, trace, cartoon).\nTry these styles, including the only option. This option allows the action not to be superimposed on previous ones (in this case, the superimposition of representations). To do this, copy, paste, and execute on each separate line the code snippet that follows in the Jmol Console, whose rendering illustrates the fluoxetine molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\nload $fluoxetine # loads the molecule\nwireframe only # wireframe style\ncpk only # filled space\ncpk 20 only, bond 1 # balls and sticks\ncartoon only # cartoon representation, but this does not occur with small molecules, only with biomacromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, for example)\n\nNote also that the cartoon representation does not result in a rendering for the fluoxetine model. This is because the cartoon representation is restricted to biopolymers only, i.e., proteins and nucleic acids, and some supramolecular associations.\nHowever, if you want to try cartoon, you will need to know the alphanumeric code for a protein or nucleic acid. For example, for myoglobin, an oxygen-carrying protein in mammals (code: 1mcy)\n\nload=1mcy # loading myoglobin\n\n# Note: note that the command line for biopolymers is slightly different from that used for small molecules\n\nNote that the default rendering for large molecules is balls and sticks, which is not very educational for learners. In this case, it can be represented as a unique drawing by typing:\n\ncartoon only # rendering as a drawing\n\nTo obtain this and other protein and nucleic acid codes, enter the PDB - Protein Data Bank, RCSB database and type the name in the search field (in this case, myoglobin). The system returns several structural models and their codes. Simply transcribe one of these codes to the JSmol Console.\nIf you would like to learn more about biomolecules and the use of Jmol, I invite you to visit the Biochemistry portal."

Suppose you want to make a simple graph, taking two columns, each for a variable (independent or x, and dependent, or y). The usual thing would be to click on a menu item for graphs, select the desired columns in specific fields of the window that opens, select the type of graph, click on next or a similar term, select other characteristics (labels or names on the x and y axes, for example), and finally click on finish (or OK, or a term with a similar meaning). Simple, fast, and practical.\nBut (there’s always a “but”)…what if, in addition to constructing the graph, you needed to perform additional actions, such as obtaining the linear fit of the data, displaying the resulting line with a specific color and style, inserting the line equation at a specific point on the graph, adding a title, and changing the symbol of the points, including the type, size, and color. Phew!!!\nNo problem, either… as long as you have a good tutorial at hand, of course! Or that you are already familiar with the spreadsheet program, menus, and actions relevant to the various mouse clicks that will be necessary to obtain a nice linear regression graph at the end.\nNow… one more small variable to add to the example above: suppose that you are not the one constructing the graph, but a student in your class, and that they have not been trained in the use of the spreadsheet or in the intended calculations!\nNotice that now there will be some discomfort, since:\n\nThe student has no prior knowledge of how to use the spreadsheet;\nThe student has no prior knowledge of the intended calculations;\nYou will have to train the student or provide them with a related training guide;\nIf training has already taken place but the guide is not available, both you and the student will depend on your memory retention to successfully complete the task.\n\nNow, what if the instructions for executing the final product were not in a guide for repeating mouse clicks, but rather in a short text containing both the commands in sequence and explanatory comments for each individual action, and that when inserted into the program, it generated the graph already fully formatted, colored, and with the linear adjustment and result parameters?"

Separating commands with \";\" - e.g., \"cpk only; color blue\"\n2. Separating commands by lines - e.g.,\n\"cpk only\ncolor blue\"\n\nIf you want the model to perform a few commands, the best option is to separate them with semicolons (“;”).

    "text": "Some recommendations on typing in an R script:\nThere are some basic premises for an R script to be read clearly by its creator, as well as compiled correctly by the program:\n\nTyping: whenever there is an error in the script in Rstudio, a red cross will appear on the left side of the command line; once the error is overcome, the sign disappears;\nComments: so that the script can also be read by “a human being”, it is advisable to include comments in the command lines (starting with # ) - one of the bases of Reproducible Teaching;\nIdentation: allow “indentation” when the line is a little long, by clicking the Enter key after separating arguments with a “comma”. This way, the line continues just below, but with a small shift to the right. This makes the code easier to read.\nNames: R commands are in English. Therefore, you should avoid using variables and file names with accents or graphic symbols in Portuguese (e.g. ç, ~). Furthermore, R is a code compiler. If you define a compound name for a file or variable, that is, with a space between the terms (as is normal in everyday life, e.g. my file), R will try to execute the terms separately (e.g. “my”, and then “file”), which will interrupt the reading and give you an error message. Therefore, for variable and file names, give preference to one of the 3 types of common conventions used in programming, namely:\n\n\nseparation by underscore, ” _ “ or hyphen; e.g. my_variable, my-variable\nseparation by capital letters; e.g. myVariable\nseparation by periods; e.g. my.Variable"

    "text": "Building interactive graphics with plotly\n\nObjectives:\n1. Understand what “plotly” is for and its interactive potential for teaching and learning\n2. Use “plotly” through scripts to build interactive graphics\n3. Check the interactivity of the created graphics\n\n\nThe plotly library is one of the richest in R for interactive graphics. It allows, among other things, zoom effects on the graph, as well as mouse over, in which simply passing the mouse over an element of the graph opens the information for that point. In addition, it allows user-controlled animations, the insertion of selectors, sliders, menus and buttons.\n\n\nIn addition, because it allows integration with a language of these times called JavaScript, the library is also used in some data panels, such as in Power Bi from Microsoft, a collection of connected applications for data visualization. In fact, it is the plotlyjs library itself written in JavaScript, external to R and RStudio, that is incorporated into R.\nCreating graphs with plotly requires a few simple commands. And the good news is that the graph produced already “comes out” with interactivity, such as enlargement/reduction, data displacement on axes, and information effects when passing the mouse, saving as a PNG image, among others. To build any graph you need data. Basically, there are 3 ways to obtain the data:\n\n* Creating the data;\n* Creating an equation that will generate the data;\n* Importing the data (from a spreadsheet, for example)\n\n\n## Creating an interactive graph\nLet’s start by creating the data from an equation applied to a vector. To do this, we need…the vector! Visualize a vector as if it were an Excel column (or row). In R, vectors are created by concatenating values ​​separated by commas, as follows:\n\nx = c(1,2,3,4,5) # a vector; the \"c\" indicates \"concatenation\"\n# assigns values ​​from 1 to 5 to the variable \"x\"\n\n# Alternatively,\n\nx = 1:5 # also assigns values ​​from 1 to 5 to the variable \"x\"\n\nTo create the interactive graph, let’s illustrate the vertical launch equation below.\n\n\nNow we will create an interactive graph from this data. But first, of course, you need to install the plotly package in R. You can install it from the Packages tab of RStudio, if you haven’t already done so, and as explained in the previous section on Packages.\n\n\nFinal step… build a scatter plot of the vertical ascent function.\nTo do this, simply copy the snippet below and paste it into a new R script. And run it in any of the ways mentioned in the previous section.\n\n\n\n# Data:\nt = 1:20 # define the time vector\nVo = 100 # initial velocity, 100 m/s\ng = 9.8 # acceleration of gravity, m/s^2\n\n# Equation (vertical ascent):\n\nH = Vo*t-1/2*g*t^2\n\n# Interactive graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = ~t, y = ~H)\n\n\n\n\n# Note:\n# Plotly syntax: ~variable, to assign a variable (x or y)\n# type: to assign a graph type\n\nR usually displays some messages (Warnings) after running the commands. They are not errors, but additional information, such as when reproducing the previous graph. In this case, the information that is missing is to characterize the type of graph, a scatter plot (scatter):\n\nplot_ly(x = t, y = H, type = 'scatter')\n\nNow observe how much interactivity arose with the simple command above, passing the mouse over the points on the graph, or clicking on the icons that appeared above the graph. Test this interactivity:\n\nPassing the mouse over the points on the graph (hover) you will obtain the coordinates of each point;\nUsing the mouse scroll button you will enlarge or reduce the graph\nClicking with the left mouse button on any part of the graph and drawing a rectangle you will obtain an enlargement of the area;\nIf you double-click after enlarging you will return to the original graph;\nBy positioning the mouse pointer between the values ​​of an axis and dragging the mouse, you will see a shift of the selected axis;\nBy selecting an icon in the upper right corner of the graph, you can, in sequence from the left, download the plot as an image, perform an enlargement, shift the axes, select the points inside a box or inside a loop, enlarge, reduce, scale to the original size, realign the axes to those of the original plot, observe the coordinates (x and y), observe only the y coordinate, and return to the beginning."

Choose a name for the graph and save it\n\nNow, just locate the file on your computer, open it automatically in a browser, and check that its interactivity has been maintained.

    "text": "Working with mathematical relationships in variables\nSometimes it is interesting to construct a graph that allows you to perform a calculation on a variable, without having to create a new vector. Let’s illustrate this for an isothermal transformation from the study of gases (Boyle-Mariotte law), as follows:\n\n\n\nPressure and volume relationship in an isothermal transformation. Source: MAPA: high school - Natural sciences and their technologies. 2nd Bim. 3rd Year, p.28.\n\n\nFor example, if you are working on a spreadsheet (e.g.: Excel) and want to construct a graph of the above relationship, say V versus p, you will have to create a column with this operation. In plotly, as well as in R as a whole, this is not necessary, since p can be considered as 1/V constant. In fact, this constant is represented by the general constant of ideal gases, R, of known value.\nSolving for the situation above:\n\n# Data:\nR = 8.314 # J/(mol*K), general constant of ideal gases\nV = seq(0,22.4, length.out=50) # vector of \"Volume\" (in liters), with 50 points\nT = 298 # K, absolute temperature\n\n# Equation\n# pV = RT; p = RT/V\np = R*T/V\n\n# Graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = V, y = ~R*T/V, type = 'scatter', mode='lines')\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you want to name the axis labels and provide a title to the graph to better present the physical meaning of the quantities involved, simply add the layout command, as follows:\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(magrittr) # library for the pipe operator \"%&gt;%\"\nplot_ly(x = V, y = ~R*T/V, type = 'scatter', mode='lines') %&gt;%\nlayout(\ntitle = \"Isothermal Transformation of a Gas\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"Volume V, L\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"Pressure p, bar\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s up to you:\nOpen a new script and build a graph that presents any relationship between variables, as suggested below:\n\nCreate the values of the independent variable (ex: x = 1:10);\n\nLoad the plotly library - library(plotly) ;\n\nType a general command line for the graph:\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~sqrt(x), type = \"scatter\")\n\nSelect these lines, press Ctrl+Enter, and observe the output (i.e., the graph, in the plots tab;\n\nModify the variable “y”, replacing the value of “x” with some other relation, such as: ~exp(x) - exponential, ~sin(10*x) - sine, ~sqrt(x)` - square root;\n\n\n\n\n## Other types of graphs\nIt is also possible to create other graphs, such as lines, bars, histograms, or box-plots (“box and whiskers”). Some of these possibilities are illustrated below.\n\n\n\nSome types of graphs presented in the Support Manual. Source: MAPA: high school - Mathematics and its technologies. 2nd Bim. 3rd Year, p.9, 10, 22, and 23.\n\n\nIn plotly there is a range of possible graphs. Try some types:\n\n# Lines\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~x, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Bars\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nclasses &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") # data for the bar graph\npercentages &lt;- c(25, 35, 20, 20)\n\nplot_ly(x = ~classes, y = ~percentages, type = 'bar')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nclasses &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\") # data for the bar chart\npercentages &lt;- c(25, 35, 20, 20)\n\n# Pie chart\nplot_ly(labels = classes, values = percentages, type = 'pie')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Histogram\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nx &lt;- rnorm(1000) # command to generate random data in `R`\nplot_ly(x = ~x, type = \"histogram\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Boxplot\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nx &lt;- rnorm(50) # generate random data\ny &lt;- rnorm(50, mean = 1) # generate statistical variation in the data\n\nplot_ly(y = ~x, type = \"box\", name = 'Group 1') %&gt;% # add the two boxes for the data\nadd_trace(y = ~y, type = \"box\", name = 'Group 2')\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to combine some types, such as a points and lines plot:\n\n# Points and lines\nlibrary(plotly)\nx &lt;- 1:10\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~x^2, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers, lines') # also works if 'markers+lines'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 3D plots\nTo end this part, three-dimensional plots! The basic version of a 3D plot is very simple to execute in plotly, and its visual and interactive effect are very expressive!\nAn example of a 3D plot can be obtained from the relations of radius, surface area, and volume of a sphere, as follows.\n\n\n\nMathematical relations of surface area and volume of a sphere in function of its radius. Source: MAPA: high school - Mathematics and its technologies. 1st Bim. 3rd Year, p.15.\n\n\nNow let’s create the interactive 3D graph in plotly. The simplest would be with the labels with the standard names, x, y and z. But it is better to add the layout command to give physical meaning and improve the interpretation of the graph.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Data:\nr = seq(0,100, length.out = 50)\nAreaSup = 4*pi*r^2 # calculation of the surface area of ​​the sphere\nVolume = 4/3*pi*r^3 # calculation of the volume of the sphere\n\n# Graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = r, y = AreaSup, z = Volume,\nmode= 'markers+lines')%&gt;%\nlayout(scene = list(\nxaxis=list(title=\"radius\"),\nyaxis=list(title=\"surface area\"),\nzaxis=list(title=\"volume\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the graph is also interactive about other aspects, such as its rotation on any of the 3 axes. From a content point of view, this graph illustrates how the values of surface area, and even more so of volume, vary enormously depending on the radius of a sphere. This also partly explains the great success of the use of nanoparticles in Science and Technology today (high surface area in a reduced size).\nAnother interesting three-dimensional graph is that of 3D surface. Like the one above, few lines are needed to define it. The difference is that you can work with an equation, for the surface, see:\n\nx &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 50)\ny &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 50)\nz &lt;- outer(x, y, function(x, y) x^2 - y^2) # equation x^2+y^2\n\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, type = 'surface') %&gt;%\nlayout(title = \"Surface Plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other types of graphs for plotly, so it is worth visiting the website for more information."

The slider control can be useful when you want to focus on a certain region of the graph. For example, adjusting the CO\\(_{2}\\) emissions for the last few years.\n\nAdding a dropdown menu\nDropdown menus allow you to see a different graph for each option selected. To illustrate this interactive feature, let’s first create a data set (dataframe) that contains the linear, quadratic, and cubic responses to an independent variable, as follows:\n\nx = 1:10 # vector of the independent variable \"x\"\nyLin = x\nyQuad = x^2 # creation of the quadratic dependent variable\nyCub = x^3 # creation of the cubic dependent variable\n\ndatLQC &lt;-data.frame(x,yLin,yQuad,yCub) # creation of the data sheet\n\nNow we can insert the dropdown for the mathematical trends option:\n\nplot_ly(datLQC, x = ~x, y = ~yLin, type = \"scatter\", mode = \"line\", name = \"Linear\") %&gt;%\nadd_trace(x = ~x, y = ~yQuad, mode = \"line\", name = \"Quadratic\") %&gt;%\nadd_trace(x = ~x, y = ~yCub, mode = \"line\", name = \"Cubic\") %&gt;%\nlayout(\ntitle = \"Power Plots\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"x\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"x^n\"),\nupdatemenus = list(\nlist(\nbuttons = list(\nlist(label = \"yLin\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)))),\n list(label = \"yQuad\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)))),\n list(label = \"yCub\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))))\n ) \n)\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though you may find the code snippet above a bit complicated, just copy it, paste it into a script, and run it. This exemplifies the essence inherent in Reproducible Teaching, from the simple reproduction of the code, to its modification and even the creation of new ones. Feeling curious, you can change some terms in the code above, such as the labels (label, replace a name, for example) that appear in the drop-down menu, the type of graph intended (replace scatter with bar, for example), or the title of the graph (title).\n\n\nRegarding the interactivity produced, it is added to that which was already present by the plot_ly command, the selection of the type of power to be represented by the drop-down menu.\n\n\nAs with many R packages, there are a significant number of commands and interactive widgets with plotly, which, in this specific case, would be enough to cover a separate literary work. However, you can consult numerous websites about plotly for a more comprehensive learning, the links below, and even a free online book with related codes and graphs.

    "text": "Life expectancy & Gross Domestic Product\nA very interesting use for plot_ly in graphic animation occurs when we need to present various data on a given topic. This is called multivariate data. To illustrate this situation, let’s say you want to offer varied information in a graph that involves the relationship between a country’s gross domestic product and the life expectancy of its inhabitants over time. \\\n\n\n\nSome economic indexes associated with life expectancy in 2001. Source: MAPA: high school - Humanities and their technologies. 1st Bim. 2nd Year, p.101.\n\n\nTo illustrate the interactive richness that can be obtained by plotly about the influence of the gross domestic product - GDP on life expectancy, we can import a data set from the internet and create a graph about this relationship, see:\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Obtaining the data from the internet\nurl &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpida &lt;- url # assigning the data to an `R` object\n\n# Creating the interactive graph\nplot_ly(\ndadosExpida, # data converted from the internet\nx = ~gdpPercap, # name of the per capita income column in the data\ny = ~lifeExp, # name of the life expectancy column in the data\ntype = 'scatter', # type of graph (scatter)\nmode = 'markers' # type of scatter (points)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! Simple, direct, and interactive code. If you move the mouse over the points you will see the GDP and life expectancy coordinates. However, it is not possible to know from this graph who is who, that is, which country has which GDP, as well as other information that is contained in the original spreadsheet downloaded from the internet. To give you an idea, this spreadsheet contains, in addition to the GDP and life expectancy values, the country and its population, the continent to which it belongs, as well as the year in which the data was measured.\n\n\nThus, we are faced with a multivariate data table, very common in various databases, such as IBGE or DATASUS.\n\n\nWhat if we could present everything at once, that is, GDP, life expectancy, the country, the population size, the country, the continent, and the year of measurement of all this, that is, six variables, between numeric and categorical (classes)?!\n\n\nImpossible?! Don’t stop R!! Here is a code snippet for this, and with the proposed result. Don’t worry about the size or details. If you want to reproduce this code, you know what to do… just copy, paste, and run the code in an R script. \\\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Getting the data from the internet\nurl &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpida &lt;- url # assigning the data to an `R` object\n\n# Creating the interactive graph with animation\nplot_ly(\ndadosExpida, # data converted from the internet\nx = ~gdpPercap, # per capita income\ny = ~lifeExp, # life expectancy\nsize = ~pop, # size of the points as a function of the population\ncolor = ~country, # color of the points as a function of the country\nframe = ~year, # Frame for the animation by year of data collection\ntext = ~continent, # Country as information when hovering the mouse\nhoverinfo = \"text\",\ntype = 'scatter', # type of graph\nmode = 'markers',\nmarker = list(sizemode = 'diameter', opacity = 0.7)\n) %&gt;%\nlayout( # assigning title and axis labels\ntitle = \"Gross Domestic Product X Life Expectancy\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"GDP (log), US$\", type = \"log\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"Life Expectancy, years\"),\nshowlegend = TRUE # whether or not to display the legend\n) %&gt;%\nanimation_opts(\nframe = 1000, # Animation speed\ntransition = 0,\nredraw = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo go to the “playground” now, press PLAY and observe the temporal transition of life expectancy as a function of the countries’ GDP. And notice that all the other data is there, separated by point size (population), color (country), continent (hover, mouse over), and year (animation frame or frame)!\n\n\nOne more detail! If you look at the legend, you’ll see that it also slides, identifying each country by a color. Want to know where Brazil is in this crazy graph’s relationship between GDP and life expectancy? Easy. Find Brazil in the legend, double-click, and notice that now only that point is highlighted."

    "text": "7 - Interactive maps with plotly\n\nObjectives:\n1. Learn about the potential of “plotly” for creating interactive maps\n2. Create an interactive map with inserted data\n3. Create an interactive map with imported data\n\n\nFinally, we leave this last part of our course to present you with another “very cool” potential of plotly for teaching and learning: the creation of interactive maps.\nInteractive maps allow you to view information by mouse hover (passing the mouse over the data) or by clicking the mouse on a map containing this data. Since it is a map, the information is obtained in specific geographic coordinates. This characteristic therefore makes the longitude and latitude coordinates related to the geographic points that you want to present indispensable.\nHere is a simple example, locating the three municipalities in the South of Minas Gerais where the campuses of the Federal University of Alfenas (UNIFAL-MG) are located.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Create sample data with coordinates of some cities\ncities &lt;- data.frame(\nname = c(\"Alfenas\", \"Varginha\", \"Poços de Caldas\"),\nlat = c(-21.42943530, -21.539957, -21.783731), # Latitude\nlon = c(-45.95948212, -45.433960, -46.564178) # Longitude\n)\n\n# Create the interactive map\nplot_ly(\ndata = cities,\nlat = ~lat,\nlon = ~lon,\ntype = 'scattergeo',\nmode = 'markers+text',\ntext = ~name,\nmarker = list(size = 10, color = 'blue', opacity = 0.7),\ntextposition = \"top center\"\n) %&gt;%\nlayout(\ntitle = \"Campi Municipalities of UNIFAL-MG\",\ngeo = list(\nscope = 'south america',\nshowland = TRUE\n)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see the cities, zoom in on the image with the mouse. Note that the map starts in South America, a condition inserted in the code to make it easier to search for cities. Try placing a comment (#) to the left of the “scope = …“ section, and the information will come from the world map.* Now notice that when you move the mouse over the cities, the proposed geographic coordinates are identified.\n\n\n\nNow it’s up to you:\n\nFind the geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) of your hometown, or that of a loved one. To do this, search the internet;\nCopy the code above, and paste it into a new script;\nReplace the attributes “name”, “lat”, and “lon” in the data.frame of the code you searched for.\nRun the script and observe the chosen municipality on the interactive map. Tip: if you selected a city outside of South America, put a “#” before the “scope = …“ line."

Note that there is a sidebar showing the legend about the quantity of production, in Also note that the “type” of the graph is now choroplet (and not scattergeo). In its simplest version, it only needs the standardized names of the countries. But it can also be done with a database that only has the geographic coordinates of latitude and longitude.\nTo help in this direction, here are two practical links to geographic coordinate files, accessible by R:\n\nCoordinates of Brazilian municipalities\nCoordinates of world capitals\n\nAnd in this case, any database in this regard will be welcome. Which means in practice being able to exemplify any information of didactic content interactively on a map (e.g.: production/export of inputs, clinical observations, historical landmarks, etc.)."

    "text": "1 How to load a molecule into JSmol\nJSmol is nothing more than Jmol itself, only developed for use in an internet browser, and which uses JavaScript among its languages (hence the S in JSmol).\nAssuming that you have already opened the window for the JSmol applet in your browser but, contrary to what was done before (molecule name at the end of the site PubChem), you want to:\n\nload a molecule from another database;\nload a molecule whose file is already on your computer\n\nWell, in that case you can use the mouse or a command line, whichever you prefer.\n\n1.1 Loading the molecule with the mouse\nTo do this, simply right-click on the screen, as before, and select File–&gt;Load. The options that appear are:\n\n* Open local file # opens a window to search for the model file on your computer;\n* Open URL # opens a window to search for the internet address that has the file\n* Get PDB file # opens a window to enter a macromolecule code from the website of the same name (mainly proteins and nucleic acids)\n* Get MOL file # opens a window to search for a *.mol file\n* Open script # opens a window to search for a piece of code on the computer\n\nThe first option is self-explanatory (Open local file), the second option (Open URL) depends on the correct address for a given molecular model, the third (Get PDB file) refers to the Protein Data Brookhaven database for biopolymers, the fourth (Get MOL file) involves searching online in a specific database for small molecules, and the last (Open script), searching for a file containing lines of Jmol code for a set of actions.\nAs textbooks cover small molecular structures, usually associated with functional groups in Inorganic and Organic Chemistry, as well as specific examples in areas such as Health, Biotechnology, and Industry, including some macromolecule models, it can be concluded that you are more likely to use remote search for small molecules (Get MOL file), molecules contained on your computer (Open local file), and/or biomacromolecules (Get PDB file).\nLoading small molecules is identical to what was tried by adding the model name to the end of the JSmol address. Remote loading for protein, enzyme, and nucleic acid models requires knowledge of their PDB code or a keyword search on the Protein Data Brookhaven website.\nLoading molecules saved on your PC involves a few steps, namely:\n\nObtain the molecule model from the internet, or build it yourself;\nDownload the file corresponding to the model (usually with an attribute *.mol, *.cif, *.cml, *.sdf, among more than 60 formats);\nLoad it onto the JSmol page in one of two ways:\n\n\n1. By clicking: File --&gt; Load --&gt; Open local file ;\n2. By dragging the file from the folder where it is located to the JSmol tab in the browser.\n\n\nFor example, let’s say you want to view the structure of aspirin downloaded to your computer.\n\nNow it’s up to you:\n\nGo to the Pubchem website: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nType aspirin in the field and click on the 3D image that appears;\nDownload the model by clicking on Download Coordinates, and then on the SDF option;\nClick on the first link to open the information about aspirin Download the structural model of aspirin from PubChem;\nOpen the JSmol Console in your browser (right-click on the screen and select “Console”);\nAlternatively:\n\n\nLocate the file on your PC by going to “File–&gt;Load–&gt;Open local file,” then click “Load” to load it;\nClick on the downloaded file (“aspirin.sdf”, for example) and drag it directly into the JSmol window.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Loading the molecule via command line\nLoading a particular model via command line is restricted to searching for it on the internet, in databases, or on web pages. To do this, open the Console as explained above. The upper part is used to display the results of the commands, and the lower part is used to type them. In this case, click on the lower box of the Console and type the loading command, shown here as an example for an alkane:\n\nload $alkane\n\nThe Jmol Console, although it is a command programming language in its own right, has an interesting advantage over other programming languages: commands can be entered in the Console using either upper or lower case letters, and in both singular and plural forms.\nYou can try with other molecules, such as aspirin, cholesterol, phenol, etc. (names in English, due to the database). To retrieve a command line that was written previously, simply navigate between the commands that were used with the up and down arrows on the keyboard (command history).\nMolecular models are loaded from the database Cactus - CADD Group Chemoinformatics Tools and User Services\n\n\n1.2 Building the molecule using SMILES\nNo, it is not a literal translation of “smiles”, but rather a coding of structures for text. In this format, you can load a molecule using SMILES codes, and the system fills in the complementary hydrogen atoms.\nTry this formatting at the address below.\n\nhttps://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=C\n\nThen replace the model of the link, “model=” with the following SMILES codes, alternatively:\n\n1. Single bond: CC, CN, CO\n2. Double bond: C=C, C=N, C=O\n3. Triple bond: N%23N, CC%23C\n\nNote: Although it seems strange (and it is!), the code for the triple bond is intended to circumvent the *SMILES* command, *“#”*, which is interpreted differently in internet addresses.\n\n\n\n1.3 Loading biopolymers (proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids) via command line\nAs mentioned above, biological macromolecules are loaded by identifying an alphanumeric code from the PDB-Protein Data Bank database. After obtaining this code, you can load the biopolymer via the online link or the Console. But be aware that the instructions are different (and don’t ask me why?!):\n\nThrough the Console:\nload=XXXX # where XXXX is the macromolecule code\n# Note: Note that the \"$\" sign is replaced by \"=\" for the PDB\n\nThrough the online link:\npdbid=XXXX\n# Note: As the link is more complicated, here is a complete example for bungarotoxin, a snake protein toxin:\n# https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?&pdbid=1ik8\n\nThis can be illustrated by remotely loading the spike protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as follows:\n\n1. Go to the PDB-Protein Data Bank website - https://www.rcsb.org/ ;\n2. In the search field, type \"spike sars-cov-2\" ;\n3. Select the first option (the website will direct you to several structures of the spike protein);\n4. Memorize the code of the first option (although any of them will work), i.e., \"7FCD\";\n5. Enter the line to load the protein: \"load=7FCD\" (upper or lower case letters are acceptable)\n\nThe default representation for proteins in Jmol is wireframe. To view the virus protein in a more “friendly” way, similar to how it appears in texts or on the internet, enter the commands below, your first sequence in programming language.\n\ncartoon only # exclusive representation of the biopolymer structure\ncolor chain # coloring by protein \"chains\"\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation of the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (coloring by number of chains).\n\n\nProteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, and macromolecular associations are more relevant to the study of structural Biochemistry. In this regard, I invite you to visit a section of the website that has detailed descriptions and representations of Biochemistry structures with the help of Jmol."

In the same way, you can use Jmol, both in the version downloaded to the computer, and in the online version. For the downloaded version, just look at the range of menu items and submenus. As for the browser version, notice that there is no menu!\nHowever, the online version allows you to view the same information, although with a different format, by simply clicking with the right mouse button on any area of ​​the screen (a fancy name for a screen containing some information, the molecule, in this case)."

Suppose you want to make a simple graph, taking two columns, each for a variable (independent or x, and dependent, or y). The usual thing to do would be to click on a menu item for graphs, select the desired columns in specific fields in the window that opens, select the graph type, click on next or some similar term, select other characteristics (labels or names on the x and y axes, for example), and finally click on finish (or OK, or a term with a similar meaning). Simple, quick, and practical.\nBut (there’s always a “but”)…what if, in addition to building the graph, you needed to perform additional actions, such as obtaining the linear fit of the data, displaying the resulting line with a specific color and style, inserting the equation of the line at a specific point on the graph, adding a title, and changing the symbol of the points, both the type, size and color. Phew!!!\nNo problem, either…as long as you have a good tutorial at your side, of course! Or that you are already familiar with the spreadsheet program, menus and actions related to the various mouse clicks that will be necessary to obtain a beautiful linear regression graph at the end.\nNow…one more small variable to add to the example given: suppose that it is not you who builds the graph, but a student in your discipline, and that they have not been trained in the use of the spreadsheet, nor in the intended calculations!\nNote that now there will be some discomfort, since:\n\nThe student has no prior knowledge in using the spreadsheet; 2. The student has no prior knowledge of the intended calculations;\nYou will have to train the student, or offer him/her a related training guide;\nIf the training has already taken place, but you do not have the guide at hand, both you and the student will depend on the memory retention capacity to successfully complete the task.\n\nNow, what if the instructions for executing the final product were not in a guide for repeating mouse clicks, but in a short text containing both the commands in sequence and the explanatory comments for each individual action, and that when inserted into the program generated the graph already formatted, colored, and with the linear adjustment and the result parameters?"

Separating the commands by lines - ex:\n\"cpk only\ncolor blue\"\n\nIf you want the model to perform a few commands, the best option is to separate them with a semicolon (“;”).

    "text": "How to load a molecule in JSmol\nJSmol is nothing more than Jmol itself, but developed to be used in an internet browser, and which uses JavaScript among its languages ​​(hence the S in JSmol).\nAssuming that you have already opened the JSmol applet window in your browser but, contrary to what was done before (molecule name at the end of the PubChem website, you want to:\n\nload a molecule from another database;\nload a molecule whose file is already on your computer\n\n\nWell, in this case you can use the mouse or a command line, whichever you prefer.\n\n\n\nLoading the molecule with the mouse\nTo do this, simply right-click on the screen, as before, and select File–&gt;Load. The options that appear are:\n\n* Open local file # opens a window to search for the model file on the computer;\n* Open URL # opens a window to search for the internet address that contains the file\n* Get PDB file # opens a window to insert a code macromolecule from the homonymous website (proteins, nucleic acids, mainly)\n* Get MOL file # opens a window to search for a *.mol file\n* Open script # opens a window to search for a code snippet on the computer\n\nThe first option is self-explanatory (Open local file), the second option (Open URL) depends on the correct address for a given molecular model, the third (Get PDB file) refers to the Protein Data Brookhaven database for biopolymers, the fourth (Get MOL file) involves searching online in a specific database for small molecules, and the last (Open script), the search for a file containing lines of Jmol code for a set of actions.\nAs textbooks cover small molecular structures, typically associated with the functional groups of Inorganic and Organic Chemistry, as well as specific examples in areas such as Health, Biotechnology and Industry, also including some models of macromolecules, it is concluded that you will most likely use remote search for small molecules (Get MOL file), molecules on your computer (Open local file), and/or biomacromolecules (Get PDB file).\nLoading small molecules is identical to what was experienced by adding the model name to the end of the JSmol address. Remote loading for protein, enzyme and nucleic acid models involves knowing the PDB code of these, or searching for keywords on the Protein Data Brookhaven website.\nLoading molecules stored on the PC involves a few steps, namely:\n\nObtain the molecule model from the Internet, or build it;\nDownload the file corresponding to the model (usually with a *.mol, *.cif, *.cml, *.sdf attribute, among more than 60 formats);\nLoad the JSmol page using two alternative methods:\n\n\n1. By clicking the mouse: File --&gt; Load --&gt; Open local file ;\n2. By dragging the file from the folder where it is located to the JSmol tab in the browser.\n\n\nFor example, let’s say you want to view the structure of aspirin downloaded to your computer.\n\nNow it’s up to you:\n\nAccess the Pubchem website: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nType aspirin in the field and click on the 3D image that appears; 1. Download the model by clicking on Download Coordinates, and then clicking on the SDF option;\nClick on the 1st link to open the aspirin information Download the aspirin structural model from PubChem;\nOpen the JSmol Console in the browser (right-click on the screen and select “Console”);\nAlternatively:\n\n\nLocate the file on your PC by “File–&gt;Load–&gt;Open local file”, then clicking on “Load” to load it;\nClick on the downloaded file (“aspirin.sdf”, for example) and drag it directly to the JSmol window.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Loading the molecule via command line\nLoading a particular model via the command line is limited to searching for it on the Internet, in a database or on web pages. To do this, open the Console as explained above. The top part is used to display the results of the commands, and the bottom part is used to type them. In this case, click on the bottom frame of the Console and type the loading command, exemplified here for an alkane:\n\nload $alkane\n\nThe Jmol Console, although it is its own programming language for commands, has an interesting advantage over other programming languages: it is possible to execute the command via the Console with both upper and lower case letters, and in both the singular and plural.\nYou can try with other molecules, such as aspirin, cholesterol, phenol etc (names in English, because of the database). To retrieve a command line that was written previously, simply navigate between the commands that were used with the up and down arrows on the keyboard (command history).\nMolecular models are loaded from the Cactus - CADD Group Chemoinformatics Tools and User Services database.\n\n\nLoading biopolymers (proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids) via the command line\nAs mentioned above, loading biological macromolecules occurs by identifying an alphanumeric code for the same in front of the PDB-Protein Data Bank database. After obtaining this code, you can load the biopolymer via the online link or via the Console. But know that they are different instructions (and don’t ask me why?!):\n\nBy Console:\nload=XXXX # where XXXX is the code of the macromolecule\n# Note: Note that the \"$\" sign is replaced by \"=\" for the PDB\n\nBy online link:\npdbid=XXXX\n# Note: Since the link is more \"tricky\", here is a complete example for bungarotoxin, a protein venom of snakes:\n# https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?&pdbid=1ik8\n\nThis can be illustrated by remotely loading the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, as follows:\n\n1. Access the PDB-Protein Data Bank website - https://www.rcsb.org/ ; 2. In the search field, type \"spike sars-cov-2\";\n3. Select the 1st option (the site will direct you to several structures of the spike protein);\n4. Memorize the code of the 1st option (although any one will do), that is, \"7FCD\";\n5. Type the line to load the protein: \"load=7FCD\" (it doesn't matter if it's upper or lower case)\n\nThe default representation for proteins in Jmol is wireframe. To visualize the virus protein in a more “friendly” way, and similar to what appears in texts or on the internet, type the commands below, your first sequence in programming language.\n\ncartoon only # exclusive representation of the drawing of the structure of biopolymers\ncolor chain # coloring by \"chains\" of the protein\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation of the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus (coloring by number of chains).\n\n\nProteins, enzymes, nucleic acids, and macromolecular associations are more relevant to the study of structural Biochemistry. In this sense, I invite you to visit a part of the authorial website that has detailed descriptions and representations of biochemical structures with the help of Jmol, the Bioquanti website\n\n\n\nBioquanti, an authorial website for quantitative studies in Biochemistry, and which includes several molecular models for Jmol."

Thus, Jmol can render the model as rod, wireframe, space-filled, ball and stick, trace, and cartoon (all in English, of course - cpk, wireframe, trace, cartoon).\nTry these styles, including the only option. This option allows the action not to be superimposed on the previous ones (in this case, the superimposition of the representations). To do this, copy, paste, and execute on each separate line the following code snippet in the Jmol Console, whose rendering illustrates the fluoxetine molecule.\n\n\n\n\n\nload $fluoxetine # load the molecule\nwireframe only # wireframe style\ncpk only # filled space\ncpk 20 only, bond 1 # balls and sticks\ncartoon only # cartoon representation, but that does not occur with small molecules, only with biomacromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, for example)\n\nAlso note that the cartoon representation does not result in a rendering for the fluoxetine model. This is because cartoon representation is restricted to biopolymers only, e.g., proteins and nucleic acids, and some supramolecular associations.\nHowever, if you want to try the cartoon, you will need to know the alphanumeric code of a protein or nucleic acid. For example, for myoglobin, an oxygen transport protein in mammals (code: 1mcy)\n\nload=1mcy # loading myoglobin\n\n# Note: note that the command line for biopolymers is slightly different from the one used for small molecules\n\nNote that the default rendering for large molecules is balls and sticks, which is not very didactic for the learner. In this case, it can be represented as an exclusive drawing by typing:\n\ncartoon only # rendering in drawing\n\nTo obtain this and other protein and nucleic acid codes, you must access the PDB - Protein Data Bank, RCSB database and type the name in the search field (in this case, myoglobin). The system returns several structural models and their codes, and you just need to transcribe one of these codes to the JSmol Console.\nIf you would like to learn a little more about biomolecules and the use of Jmol, I invite you to visit our Quantitative Biochemistry portal. There you will also find other applications for Jmol, R and RStudio, as well as a program that simulates transformations of elements present in schemes (diagrams, flowcharts, pedigrees, networks and webs) by differences in luminance between the element and its predecessor/successor (SISMA - Autocatalytic Map System)."

For example, the most basic ones for the molecule of a component of shoyo sauce, glutamate:\n\nCharges\nSometimes it may be interesting to present the polarity of molecules as a function of their charge distribution. In Jmol there are two types of charges, effective charge (formaCharge) and partial charge (partialcharge). We can illustrate the charge distribution in a surfactant molecule, such as hexadecanoate.\n.\nTo do this, type the following commands in the Console:\n\nload $hexadecanoate\ncalculate partialCharge # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %P # presentation of charges (labeling)\n\nA feature of Jmol that makes it more efficient in executing its actions is the sequential arrangement of commands. This way, it is not necessary to press Enter for each command, simply separate the commands with a semicolon (;) as illustrated below, to calculate the partial charges of the glutamate molecule:\n\n\n\nDisplay of partial charges in the glutamate model, a component of Shoyo sauce, also illustrating a sequence of actions in Jmol.\n\n\nIn the same way, it is possible to illustrate the obtaining of formal charges in the model. In this case, transparent coloring was added to better visualize the negative unitary charge of the carboxylic acid:\n\ncalculate formalcharges # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %C # presentation of charges (labeling)\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the commands in sequence to visualize formal charges in the glutamate molecule.\n\n\nNote that the commands in the figure mix upper and lower case letters, unlike the command line that precedes it. This is a really cool feature of Jmol, which doesn’t care about the capitalization or not of the font. In other words, it doesn’t matter if it’s lower case, upper case or a combination of both; Jmol executes the action in the same way.\n\nScripts & Reproducible Teaching\nThe example above shows a simple way to concatenate commands, facilitating the automatic and sequential execution of a set of these. However, the visualization of the command line is somewhat impaired by the separation by “;”, which can cause visual pollution when there are several commands.\nThe workaround involves the arrangement of the commands in the format of a script. This is nothing more than a code snippet containing one command per line, which improves the visualization of the code as a whole. In addition, the script has the additional advantage of inserting comments between the command lines, also allowing for better appropriation of the code and its learning.\nThese characteristics of a command per line with explanatory comments give Jmol its aspect for programming sequential actions, and consequently establishes one of the basic premises for Reproducible Teaching: writing code snippets in unitary commands per line, written as in a notepad, and with comments about the program’s actions on each line.\nAs an example for a script involving the actions for glutamate above, just copy the snippet below and paste it into the JSmol Console, and run it.\n\nload $glu # micromolecule loading\nwireframe only # exclusive rendering of rods\ncalculate partialCharge # partial charge\nlabel %P\n\nAnother aspect inherent to the Reproducible Teaching initiative lies in the possibility of evaluating the code with some changes, aiming for a slightly modified final product. Try repeating the snippet above, but for effective charges, that is:\n\nload $glu # micromolecule loading\ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\ncalculate formalCharge # effective charge\nlabel %C\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to act by changing more code commands, in order to create a result completely different from the original. This defines another characteristic of Reproducible Teaching, namely, the creation of a code snippet. As an illustration, here is a snippet based on the previous one, but for energy minimization and restructuring of the molecule’s orbitals.\n\nload $glu # micromolecule loading\ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\nminimize # command for minimizing the structure's energy"

And many others that imagination and technical rigor allow for study.\nIn these cases, it is interesting to know and apply a few animation commands explained below. The examples were selected in order to simplify each command. But do not be fooled about the capacity of Jmol, because for each command there are always several complementary options. And if you want to know something about any Jmol command, visit the reference site.\n\nSpin\nSimple command for rotating the molecule.\n\nload $glucose; spin 30 # the value refers to the rotation speed\n\n\n\nZoomTo (resizing the size)\nThis command is impressive, because it allows a controlled enlargement or reduction in time. Its syntax is:\n\n*zoomTo* : time (optional expression) size\n\nExamples:\n\nZoom in 3x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 *3\n\nZoom in 4x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 400\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand at 2x magnification: zoomto 2(ligand) 0\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand at 4x magnification, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5(ligand)* 4\n\n\n\nDelay\nThis is a key command for any animation, as it allows the image of the molecule in Jmol to pause (in seconds) before the next action. It is normally used in the sequence of commands by the Console, throughout a script.\n\ndelay 3 # wait 3 seconds before the next action\n\nWe can try an animation with the commands above together with the cyclohexanol model.\n\n\n\nStructure of cyclohexanol.

Recently, a portable application for graphic and interactive simulation available on the website, JSPlotly, was awarded first place in the same award and is also available on eduCAPES. With equal honor and satisfaction, we also had works classified in the National Award in its previous editions, this time for experimental work in teaching and learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nBioquanti currently offers topics for higher education in biochemistry, although due to its quantitative nature, it also includes content on physical chemistry, chemistry, biophysics, descriptive and inferential statistics, experimental design, linear algebra, integral calculus, differential calculus, and computational modeling, among others; The language is geared toward university professors and researchers, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.\n\n\n\nBioquanti for elementary and secondary education\nFor basic education, the website offers a set of instructional content and teaching objects for the final years of elementary school and high school. Its content was also designed according to the principles of reproducible teaching (RT) and involves Reproducible Teaching Interactive Objects (RTIO) for curricular content.\nIn this sense, the website presents applications of the JSPlotly (simulator) and GSPlotly (code generator) platforms directly aimed at basic education content. The website also has a tutorial on the practical use of Jmol for 3D molecules and interactivity, and another for R in the RStudio environment, for interactive graphics and maps. The tools are presented in their cloud versions, eliminating the need for installation or configuration, although there are instructions for installing the program on a machine. The tutorial is illustrated with examples taken from MAPA (Pedagogical Support Material for Learning in Minas Gerais). This content can also be accessed in the ebook Bringing Content to Life for Basic Education: Molecules, Graphics, and Interactive Maps, an adaptation for a smooth learning curve of Jmol and R & RStudio, and directly applied in the construction of reproducible interactive teaching objects (RTIO) for school content.\nThe portal also provides a collection of interactive atomic models included in a “Molecule Garden” and a repository for interactive graphics and maps as RITO. The Molecule Garden is organized into classes and has a collection of atomic models for three-dimensional visualization and study."

    "text": "1 Graphs\n\n1.1 Simple - UVM (Physics)\n  Code for uniformly varied motion (UVM), describing the position of a body as a function of time when acceleration is constant. By varying the model parameters in the code excerpt, the learner can explore the physical role of acceleration, understand the influence of initial conditions, and relate the mathematical expression of motion to real situations, such as the acceleration of a vehicle or the fall of an object.\n\nBNCC: EF09CI03, EM13CNT204, EM13CNT101\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nS(t) = S_0 + v_0,t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n(S(t)) is the position at instant (t);\n(S_0) is the initial position;\n(v_0) is the initial velocity;\n\nis the constant acceleration;\n\n\nis time.\n\n\n  Optionally, velocity as a function of time is given by:\n\\[\nv(t) = v_0 + a t\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try replacing the acceleration value and overlay the graph: \"const a = 5\", followed by \"add\";\n2. Keep the data, but replace the initial velocity value, \"const v0 = 3\", overlaying afterwards.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Selection in menu - Trigonometry (Mathematics)\n\nBNCC: EM13MAT306, EM13MAT308, EM13MAT307\n  The following simulation aims to facilitate visualization for some concepts in trigonometry, sine, cosine and tangent. The code allows using a drop-down menu for each trigonometric function, as well as a slider to change the frequency in radians.\n\n\nEquation:\n1. Sine function:\n\\[\ny = \\sin(\\omega x)\n\\]\n2. Cosine function:\n\\[\ny = \\cos(\\omega x)\n\\]\n3. Tangent function:\n\\[\ny = \\tan(\\omega x)\n\\]\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Select, alternatively, the sine, cosine, and tangent function, using the \"drop-down menu\";\n2. Try the effect of changing the frequency of the function in the slider (\"slider\");\n3. Overlay a sine graph and a cosine graph to observe their differences;\n4. Repeat the same for the tangent graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Use of selector and buttons in data fluctuation\n\nBNCC: EF07MA21, EF07GE04, EM13MAT301, EM13CHS104, EM13CNT103\n  A button accesses a given situation, while a selector allows expanding a given range of values seeking to highlight a graphical information for a function or significant fluctuations. Both are illustrated below in a simulation for temporal fluctuation of values (expressed as a sine wave modified by random additions).\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Drag the end markers of the graph to view a more restricted limit;\n2. Click the buttons with distinct periods;\n2. One can change the random noise around the mathematical equation that defines the fluctuation above by simply modifying the code line in: \"const valores = dias.map((_, i) =&gt; 50 + 10 * Math.sin(i / 10) + Math.random() * 50);\" - change \"50\" to \"5\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Slider for a function (Mathematics)\n\nBNCC: EF07MA20, EF09MA20, EM13MAT302, EM13MAT304\n  It is possible with the app to simulate a frame-by-frame animation, aiming to improve the learning of a topic, by inserting a manual sliding control. The following example presents a simulator for manual animation for mathematical functions. To use it, simply slide the slider progressively to graphically visualize the result in face of the change of the predictor variable.\nObs: This didactic object has a trick…in fact, two! After clicking add, it is necessary to slide the slider first to visualize the graph. And to visualize an animation for another equation, it is necessary to refresh the page, as instructed in the lower margin of the graphic screen.\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Slide the control to evidence the manual animation;\n2. Try replacing the model equation with another, and drag the slider control to observe the effect;\n3. Change some parameters for the animation, for example, increasing the \"frames\" levels (slider.max = \"50\"; slider.value = 1);\n4. Reload the page and change the mathematical function; ex: \"let f = x =&gt; Math.sin(x);\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5 Multiple sliders for parabola (Mathematics)\n\nBNCC: EF07MA20, EF09MA20, EM13MAT302, EM13MAT304\n  Simpler and more immediate than changes in the code, sliders (sliders) can contribute more immediately to understanding a problem, as follows for the example of the parameters of a parabola.\n\n\n1. Drag any slider, and observe the presented trend, as well as the change in the equation parameters at the top;\n2. As in the previous example, it is possible to change the mathematical function in the code, as well as the parameters for a new slider. Test this by changing the function \"  y_values = x_values.map(x =&gt; a * x * x + b * x + c);\n\" to \"  y_values = x_values.map(x =&gt; Math.sin(a * x * x + b * x + c));\"\n\n\n\n\n1.6 Fractal composition\n\nBNCC: EM13MAT301, EM13MAT305, EM13MAT401, EM13ARM502, EF09MA10\n      Fractals constitute geometric objects with scale symmetry, forming patterns that repeat in smaller parts of the original object. The most common mathematical representations are Mandelbrot fractals and Julia fractals, and which combine Art and Mathematics in geometric figures with fractional dimensions that express the degree of complexity and space occupation. Originally conceived at IBM in the 80s, fractals are today witnessed from the cartographic contour of certain regions to the distribution of living cells in culture.\n\n\nEquation\n     Julia fractals are formed on a complex Cartesian plane, by summation of the real and imaginary components. The basic formula for the Julia set is given by:\n\\[\nz_{n+1}=z_{n}^{2}+c\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nz ∈ C: usually initialized as the point of the complex plane;\nc ∈ C: fixed for each Julia set.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try changing the Real and Imaginary components of the formula, to obtain distinct artistic patterns. Suggestions:\n  c = 0 + 0i\n  c = -0.4 + 0.6i\n  c = 0.285 + 0i\n  c = -0.8 + 0.156i\n  c = 0.45 + 0.1428i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7 Fractal of Mandelbrot\n  Another interesting structure involves Mandelbrot fractals, represented by a different set of equations. The following example aggregates this fractal with a choice menu.\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Select distinct colors and magnification levels (\"zoom\") in the two menus, for distinct visualizations;\n2. Check where the equations that define the Mandelbrot profile are in the code, and make small changes to verify distinct results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.8 Normal distribution curve (Statistics)\n\nBNCC: EM13MAT316, EM13MAT407, EM13MAT312\n      Sampling and population are common topics for data observation in analytical procedures. Statistical distribution curves for this involve the t-Student, F-Snedecor, Chi-square, and normal distribution. The normal distribution curve reflects the statistical behavior for natural phenomena in a given data population.\n      The example intends to illustrate the use of the z transformation, the calculation of critical values, and the interpretation of the area under the curve in the study of the normal distribution and statistical inference.\n\n\nEquation\n      The density function of the normal (or Gaussian) distribution is given below?\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} , e^{ -\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} }\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\mu\\) = 0 (mean of the distribution);\n\\(\\sigma\\) = 1 (standard deviation);\nx = continuous random variable; f = density function of the normal distribution\n\n      From the equation above one can extract z, the value of the standardized random variable for zero mean and unit standard deviation, representing the value on the abscissa axis:\n\\[\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing the value of \"p\" and run the graph. This value represents the probability of observing, under the null hypothesis, a value as extreme or more extreme than the observed — that is, it measures the evidence against the null hypothesis. In the graph, it represents the area under the normal curve in the critical regions, indicating the chance of occurrence of the observed result by pure chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9 Compound Interest (Financial Mathematics)\n\nBNCC: EF09MA05, EM13MAT303, EM13MAT402\n  Also known by the maxim “interest on interest”, compound interest adds value to capital over time, resulting in the growth of the final amount.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nM = C \\cdot (1 + i)^t\n\\]\nWhere,\n\nM: final amount\nC: initial capital\ni: interest rate per period (in decimal)\nt: number of periods (ex: months)\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Vary the contracting period, the monthly interest rate or the initial amount.\n2. Try combining the parameters in the variation.\n3. Evaluate the visual difference between an investment and a loan, inserting a positive initial capital value for the 1st and negative for the 2nd. \n4. Observe the descending curve for a simulated loan with negative initial capital. The remaining values refer to the missing debt to pay off the loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10 Pitch, harmony and timbre of sounds (Physics)\n\n1.10.1 BNCC: EF15AR06, EM13ARH402\n      The following example illustrates the concepts of pitch (frequency), harmony and timbre (pure waves and harmonics) for a graph of musical tones (diatonic scale).\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Test other keys (C,G,D, etc), observing how the pure wave is presented by overlaying the graphs;\n2. Evaluate the difference between a pure wave and that produced with musical instruments, involving natural harmonics. For this, change the boolean option from \"false\" to \"true\" in the variable \"const ondaComposta\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.11 Oblique launch (Physics)\n\nBNCC: EF09MA07, EM13CNT102, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT302\n  The following code illustrates the trajectory of an oblique launch with angle adjustable by a slider (slider), useful for exploring kinematics concepts.\n\n\n\nEquation:\n1. General equation\n\\[\ny(x) = x \\cdot \\tan(\\theta) - \\frac{g}{2 v_0^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)} \\cdot x^2\n\\]\nWhere:\n\ny(x): height as a function of horizontal distance;\nx: horizontal position (m);\n\\(\\theta\\): launch angle relative to the horizontal (radians or degrees);\nv0: initial velocity of the projectile (m/s);\ng: acceleration of gravity (9,8 m/s²\\(^{2}\\))\n\n2. Total flight time:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g}\n\\]\n3. Horizontal position over time\n\\[\nx(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t\n\\]\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. See that there is a slider bar for initial angles in the simulation. Drag the bar to another angle and add the graph, comparing the effect of this modification.\n2. Change the initial velocity in the code, and observe the effect on the graph.\n3. Simulate a \"lunar condition\" for the trajectory, and whose gravity is around 1/6 of Earth's (~1.6 m/s²).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.12 3D graph for absorption bands as a function of concentration (Chemistry)\n\nBNCC: EF09CI04, EF09MA17, EM13CNT103, EM13MAT305\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try changing the graph pattern and its colors. Respectively: type: 'surface', colorscale: 'Viridis');\n2. Change the wavelength range, separating the peaks; for this, change the min/max lambda variables: const lambdaMin = 450, lambdaMax = 600;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.13 Heat Capacity (Physics)\n\nBNCC: EF09CI06, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT203\n  The following simulation aims to observe the relationship between exchanged heat (Q), mass (m), heat capacity (c) and temperature variation (\\(\\Delta\\)T).\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nQ = c \\cdot m \\cdot \\Delta T\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try varying the temperature initially, overlaying some graphs;\n2. Also vary the mass in the code editor, for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.14 3D graph for mixture of substances in exothermic reaction (Chemistry)\n\nBNCC: EF09CI02, EM13CNT103, EM13CNT103\n  Simulations can be performed without necessarily involving a mathematical relationship, as in the experimental observation of two variables, such as time and concentration, simulating an exothermic chemical reaction. Below is an interactive 3D example.\n  In this case, the equation used in the editor involves a smooth temperature variation over time, using the sine function and an initial temperature (see the code).\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try varying the temperature initially, overlaying some graphs;\n2. Also vary the mass in the code editor, for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.15 Interactive panel (dashboard) for environmental measurements (simulated data)\n\nBNCC: EF07MA21, EF09MA21, EM13MAT406, EM13LGG604\n  Currently it is frequent to present data in a panel containing different interactive information or data that complement each other in graphs and tables, for example. These panels allow a panoramic view of the addressed topic, as well as adjustments in contained parameters. Below is an example of a panel with simulated data for conductivity and temperature measurements in aqueous medium, and with parameters adjustable by a slider (a bit impractical, in fact, but illustrative of the app’s potential).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Even though it is an object that only simulates data acquisition, one can obtain a different result by interfering in the code, such as:\n  a. Changing the sliders: \"slider.min = \"0\";slider.max = \"24\"; slider.step = \"1\" \" ;\n  b. Changing the equations that define the behavior of the displays:\n    \"const tempo = Array.from({ length: 25 }, (_, i) =&gt; i); // 0 a 24h\n     const temperatura = tempo.map(t =&gt; 20 + 5 * Math.sin((t - 6) / 3)); // pico 12h\n     const condutividade = tempo.map(t =&gt; 100 + 30 * Math.cos(t / 5)); \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.16 Area of Brazilian biomes (Biology)\n\nBNCC: EF05GE05, EF08GE08, EM13CNT301, EM13CNT304\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. The presented data are only for simulation purposes. Wanting more robust data, safe sources are recommended (ex: MapBiomas Brasil - https://brasil.mapbiomas.org/)\n2. This is a bar chart, only that. If you change the information present in the constants of the first 3 vectors (\"const X = [...]\"), you can convert the representation to a different topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.17 Water cycle diagram (Biology)\n\nBNCC: EF06CI03, EF06CI04, EM13CNT103, EM13CNT202\n  The app also allows the creation of other interactive didactic objects, without the need to insert equations, such as diagrams and flowcharts. Examples follow.\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As for diagrams above, try changing in the code the properties of arrows and the terms and fields involved in the flowchart;\n2. Replace terms to form another flowchart;\n3. Reposition objects in the graphic area (fields, terms, arrows) with the help of the mouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.18 Flowchart of light and dark cycles of photosynthesis (Biology)\n\nBNCC: EM13CNT101, EM13CNT103, EM13CNT201, EM13MAT405\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try repositioning inputs and outputs (ex: Light, Glucose) by simple mouse dragging;\n2. Replace the terms inside the boxes, or change other aspects of the diagram (color, fill, for example).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.19 Population Growth Model with Lag Phase (Biology)\n\nBNCC: EM13CNT102, EF06MA17, EF08CI06, EM13MAT301, EM13CNT201\n  This model presents a logistic function that simulates population growth (microorganisms, cells, for example), accompanied by a delay component. By varying the parameters in the editor, it is possible to estimate various population growth profiles.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nN(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K - N_0}{N_0}\\right) \\cdot e^{-r \\cdot A(t) \\cdot t}}, \\quad \\text{com } A(t) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-k(t - t_0)}}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nK = environmental carrying capacity;\nN0 = initial population;\nr = intrinsic growth rate;\nA(t) = growth activation factor with delay (lag phase);\nt0 = midpoint of transition between lag phase and log phase;\nk = smoothing constant of the delay (fixed as 0.5 in the code)\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try varying the equation parameters, combining some, and comparing their effects on the graphs:\n  a. Carrying capacity;\n  b. Initial population;\n  c. Growth rate;\n  d. Delay (lag phase);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.20 Energy efficiency and food chain (Biology)\n\n1.20.1 BNCC: EF06CI02, EM13CNT202, EM13CNT203\n      Below is an example to portray the transferëncia of energy between different trophic levels of a food chain. Although there is not properly a mathematical function that describes it, one can apply the 10% law of ecological efficiency between the chain levels, which results in a logarithmic relationship of transfer.\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Lindeman's rule, outlined in the reference above, establishes a variation of 5-20% of energy efficiency in the ecosystem. Thus, try overlaying curves with such rates;\n2. If you want to observe the logarithmic relation of energy transfer, add the command \"type: 'log',\" right below \"title: 'Energia disponível (unidades)',\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.21 Slang spoken in Brazil from 1980-2020 (Languages)\n\nBNCC: EF89LP19, EM13LGG102\n  This simulation is directed to an estimate of the use of slang spoken in Brazil during the last 40 years. The representation is given in a pie chart, and the selection by decade in a drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n1. One can use mouseover to observe the \"tip\" presented for each data in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.22 Word frequency in text (Languages)\n\nBNCC: EM13LGG101, EM13LGG302, EM13LGG303\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try replacing the code text with another;\n2. Try varying the number of most frequent terms in the variable \"const entradas\" (optionally, also vary in the chart title, to make sense);\n3. Compare a text in Portuguese with its translation to English or another language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.23 Literary works and aesthetic movements (Languages)\n\n1.23.1 BNCC: EF89LP47, EM13LP01, EM13LP02, EM13LGG201\n  The following example illustrates the use of interactive resources, button and selector, for a set of works of national literature.\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Drag the extreme markers to enlarge the focus on a specific period of literature;\n2. Change the script adding other key works in \"const obras =\" and \"const periodos =\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.24 Creation of 3D objects (Art)\n\nBNCC: EF09MA16, EF15AR06, EM13MAT405, EM13LGG604\n  Three-dimensional objects can be generated by mathematical functions in three-dimensional space, as illustrated below.\n\n\n\n1. Try changing some values in the script, testing the result. For example, create a mat (or flattened watermelon) by changing the code in: \"const zVal = L * (t - 0.5)\"...to \"const zVal = L * (t - 20.5);\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.25 Interactive diagram about papal encyclicals (Religious Education)\n\nBNCC: EF05ER01, EF09ER02, EM13ER04\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. To perceive the dynamism of the representation, try dragging any part of the flowchart, and observe the accommodation of the others;\n2. As before, one can change the constant information in the flowchart, keeping its graphic and dynamic characteristics, simply by changing the constants used to generate the object (\"const = \").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.26 Music notation editor (Art)\n\nBNCC: EF15AR06, EF69AR22, EM13ARH402\n      The following example illustrates the concepts of pitch (key) and duration for musical notes in diatonic scale. The legends represent the duration values, and the keys are presented in their frequency values\n\n\n1. Try changing the melodic sequence in the corresponding vector in the code;\n2. Try changing the duration figures in the corresponding vector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.27 Distribution of enslaved people in the Americas in the period 1500–1888 (simulated data; History)\n\nBNCC: EF08HI06, EM13CHS104, EM13CHS503\n   This simulation presents an interactive bar chart for period selection by drop-down menu, and related to the estimated quantity of enslaved Africans disembarked in the main regions of America. The data are approximate estimates to illustrate the app’s visualization potential, although serving as a starting point for more precise educational discussions. Consultable sources include Slave Voyages.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try switching between periods in the drop-down menu, comparing the estimates of slave traffic;\n2. Select a period, create the graph, select another period, and add another graph. This allows comparing the quantity of enslaved people landed by the formed double bars, and mouseover each bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.28 Timeline for events of the Middle Ages (History)\n\nBNCC: EM13CHS101, EM13CHS102\n\nSource: Encyclopedia.com\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing in the code events and periods, and intended for another period of human History.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.29 Pottery wheel vase (STEAM)\n\nBNCC: EM13MAT101, EM13MAT403, EM13CNT204, EM13AR01, EM13AR02\n      The platform also allows creations for integration in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM). Below is an example of a simulation for ceramic turning and manual clay shaping, and that allows trying symmetric and rounded shapes, such as vases, bowls and pots, by adjusting some parameters and the trigonometric functions in the code.\n\n\n1. Change the vase height, its shape, and its colors, editing the code in the specific fields.\n\n\n\n\n1.30 Mini CAD (Computer-Aided Design- STEAM)\n\nBNCC: EM13MAT301, EM13MAT503, EM13MAT402\n      Below is an example code for manipulating geometric shapes in 3D (curves or lines) in the elaboration of a mini CAD (Computer-Aided Design).\n\n\n1. Try changing the base parameters, height and curvature of the code, also varying the sign of the values (positive, negative);\n2. Change some trigonometric function (lineX or lineY, sine to tangent, for example), and overlay on the plot;\n3. Overlay geometric figures with distinct color palette.\n4. Create symmetric figures by overlaying a curve with positive parameter with one with the same negative parameter.",

The example below illustrates the potential for understanding a histogram aggregated to an animation resource.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Observe at the top of the script the various constants that can be changed for a distinct animation, and try changing them one by one to understand both the action of the object, and the statistical content it refers to:\n  const mu = 0 (mean);\n  const sigma = 1 (standard deviation);\n  const n_frames = 50 (no. of frames);\n  const sample_per_frame = 20 (sample rate/frame);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Elastic potential energy (Physics)\n\nBNCC: EM13CNT102,EM13CNT202, EM13MAT402\n  The deformation of an elastic material is directly proportional to the force exerted on it, and limited to the properties of the material.\n\n\nEquation\n  The behavior of an ideal spring is described by Hooke’s Law below:\n\\[\nF = -k*x\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nF = restoring force of the spring (N);\nk = spring elastic constant (N/m);\nx = deformation (m).\n\n  On the other hand, the elastic potential energy involved is described by the quadratic relationship that follows:\n\\[\nE = \\frac{1}{2}*k*x^2\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nE = elastic potential energy (J).\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing the value of the spring elastic constant to evidence its effect, relating it to stiffer or less stiff springs;\n2. Change the deformation limits of the spring in the \"control structure\" of the code (ex: \"for (let x = -0.7)\"), and observe the effect on maximum potential energy;\n3. Note that, by the quadratic operation on the deformation value, the potential energy is always positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Cartographic changes over time\n\nBNCC: EF08GE09, EF07GE05, EM13CHS102, EM13CHS104\n      It may be interesting to convey geographic and/or historical information over time in the representation of a map. Below is an example.\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. One can change the formatting of the map in the code to colors (\"lakecolor\"), menu position (\"updatemenus\"), duration of transition between frames (\"transition\"), among others;\n2. This example is generic; change the constants in \"paises\", \"anos\", and \"valores\", and obtain a new map for a specific topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Oblique launch\n\nBNCC: EF09CI09, EF09MA20, EM13CNT103, EM13MAT304\n  As well as simulations, animations can help in understanding a specific topic (learning based on simulation or on animation). JSPlotly can work directly with animations with the Plotly.js library (insertion of frames, buttons, transitions, for example).\n      Below is an animation for parabolic launch of a projectile, described by the equations of the previous topic. Distinct from that one, however the insertion of an animation makes it possible to add value to the understanding of the phenomenon, by offering the possibility of parametric manipulation of the code associated with the animation itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As in the previous topic, try changing equation parameters, such as initial velocity and attack angle, and observe the effect of these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Translation motion in solar system\n\nBNCC: EF05CI08, EF07CI01, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT103\n  Dynamic representations for complex phenomena can help on the path to understanding them, regardless of the area of knowledge. In addition, simulations with approximate real data can also insert another imagery frame in the learner’s cognitive perception. The example below illustrates an animation for the translation movement of the planets of our solar system based on approximate data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Note that there is a slider at the top of the object; drag it to observe different speeds for the animation;\n2. Note that the image was made possible by \"zoom\" on the graphic screen, to improve the visualization of the planets. In this sense, try using such resource during the animation; \n2. See that there are 8 planets in the animation, not including the dwarf planet Pluto. This is not due to disregard to it, but because you can observe how slow the movement of the planets is as they move away from the Sun (see Neptune, practically static). In this sense, one verifies the potential of an animation with approximate data, bringing with it additional information not perceptible in textbooks on the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Simple harmonic motion (Physics)\n\nBNCC: EF09CI09, EF09MA18, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT203\n  Among various situations for analyzing physical properties of materials and systems, the linear relationship between applied mass and spring deformation is of significant importance. The equation that represents the position of the mass as a function of time is given below.\n\n\nEquation\n\\[\nx(t)=Acos(ωt+ϕ)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\nx(t) = the position of the mass at time t;\nA = amplitude of the motion, which is the maximum distance of the mass from the equilibrium position (in this case, x=0);\n\\(\\omega\\) = angular frequency, which defines the oscillation rate. It is calculated by 2\\(\\pi\\)/T, where T is the period (the time for a complete cycle);\n\\(\\phi\\) = initial phase or phase constant, which defines the position of the mass at t=0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing some parameters of the motion equation, such as amplitude A and angular frequency;\n2. Increase the angular frequency of the animation by reducing the denominator in \"const w\";\n2. Try the \"html\" button and evidence that the animation is preserved in the export of the file;\n3. Try the \"clone\" button and evidence that it is possible to share the object in the frozen configuration along with the modified code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7 Animated spirograph\n\nBNCC: EF07MA18, EF09MA20, EM13MAT406, EM13LGG701)\n  A spirograph consists of a playful tool composed of toothed rulers and curves for drawing, aiming at the creation of complex geometric figures (trochoids). Below is an example of an animated spirograph, combining Art and Mathematics for the creation of such figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. The object allows changing the type of hypo or hypertrochoid by menu, as well as pausing the animation by button;\n2. It is possible to change the trochoid pattern of the figures by modifying a mathematical relationship. As an example, look in the code for the line \"Math.cos(t) + d*Math.cos(k1*t);\", and change the second term to \"Math.sin\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.8 Pendular motion (Physics)\n\nBNCC: EF09CI09, EF09MA18, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT203\n  Similar to the previous object, here we have an animation for the mechanical phenomenon of periodic motion of a pendulum. The equations that describe the position of a simple pendulum as a function of time, using the small oscillations approximation, are given below.\n\n\n\n\nEquation\n\\[\nθ(t)=θ_0cos(ωt)\n\\]\n\\[\nx(t)=Lsin(θ)\n\\]\n\\[\ny(t)=−Lcos(θ)\n\\]\n\\[\nω=\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\n\\]\nWhere:,\n\nθ(t) = angular position;\nx(t) = x coordinate;\ny(t) = y coordinate;\nω = angular frequency\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As suggested for other objects, try the \"parametric exploration\" of the equation involved in the code, changing its parameters;\n2. Observe an advantageous characteristic of simulations over real experiments: performing them under conditions impossible in practice. For this, try the simulation as if you were on the Moon, changing the value of gravitational acceleration to 1.62 m/s^2 (but with \".\", and not \",\" - because it is programming syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.9 Action potential in neuron (Biology)\n\nBNCC: EF08CI08, EF09CI01, EM13CNT202, EM13CNT302\n  Some natural phenomena are observed in time, although their didactic representation in books and the like is offered in a static way. In the following example, an animation for neuronal potential facilitates learning for depolarization/hyperpolarization/repolarization events that accompany nerve transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Try changing the default values for the presented potentials in \"function potencial(i)\" of the code;\n2. Altered values are present in some neurological conditions, such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.10 Map of burned areas by biomes in Brazil\n\nBNCC: EF07CI08, EF08GE08, EM13CHS101, EM13CNT201\n      The use of maps in Natural Sciences and Human Sciences finds a common point for environmental and socio-economic problems, such as illustrated by the following animation. In it, the area in square kilometers for burnings in each Brazilian biome is offered to the animation with period and area along the title of the interactive object, and with a temporal slider below. The data are fictitious and cover the period from 1955 to 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. It is salutary to seek more precise sources of information on the addressed themes, since GSPlotly, as an AI assistant, does not guarantee the nature of the information. In the example, the \"Programa Queimadas - INPE - Terrabrasilis\" is suggested (https://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/queimadas/situacao-atual/situacao_atual/);\n2. One can insert more precise data in the script itself, in the field \"const usar_dados_ficticios = true; // change to false and fill areaBiomaAno_real()\";\n3. One can modify the theme of the animated map to any other, simply by changing the data in the constants of \"General Control\" of the script. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.11 Displacement of flying rivers (Environmental Sciences)\n  Flying rivers address the transport of large volumes of water vapor from the Amazon to other regions of South America through atmospheric circulation. The animation represents moisture particles that move from the north of Brazil toward the south and southeast, with variable intensity over time. A deforestation factor is introduced in the second half of the animation, progressively reducing the intensity of transported moisture, which allows visualizing, in a qualitative way, the impact of loss of forest cover on the rainfall regime. The spatial and temporal representation of the moisture flow helps the learner relate vegetation, climate and water availability on a continental scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Simulate the deforestation effect by reducing the associated empirical factor: \"const desmatamento_fator = 0.01\";\n2. Simulate an increase in humidity in the animation: \"const n_particulas = 1000\";\n3. Increase the dispersion of the water volume: \" const x_final = x_inicial + (i / nFrames) * (Math.random() * 50 + 10);\"\n\n\n\n\n4.12 Conway’s Game of Life\n\nBNCC: EF06MA20, EF09MA24, EM13MAT503, EM13CNT201\n  This object illustrates a version of a cellular automaton conceived in 1970 by J.H. Conway, and that simulates biological events such as birth, growth, reproduction and death, by the iterative and partially chaotic distribution of pixels on a screen. The Game allows a mathematical and visual approach for simple rules applied to complex phenomena.\n  The Game allows 4 distinct patterns (Glider, Blinker, Toad, Random), each one distributing events of birth, survival and death, as a function of mathematical relationships. One can pause to observe details of evolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. See at the top of the code that it is possible to change the grid size, time steps, and the probability of a cell being alive in \"Random\" mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.13 Second Law of Kepler (Physics)\n\nBNCC: EM13CNT101, EM13CNT201, EM13CNT204, EM13CNT206\n  The simulation exemplifies an interactive visualization for Kepler’s Second Law (Law of Areas), demonstrating that a planet sweeps equal areas in equal times along its elliptical orbit around the Sun.\n\n\nEquation:\n  The orbit is described by a parametric ellipse defined by the major a and minor b semi-axes, with the Sun positioned at one of the foci, and whose focal distance is given by:\n\\[\nc=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\n\\] | The planet position is calculated over time by means of the ellipse parametric equations, and the animation evidences the variation of orbital velocity: higher at perihelion and lower at aphelion. The parameter N controls the temporal resolution of the animation, while the increment dt allows visualizing, at each step, the area swept by the Sun–planet radius vector.\n  The simulation simultaneously highlights the orbital trajectory, the radius vector, the swept area sector and the characteristic points of the orbit, integrating geometric representation, motion and time. For a Kepler model, the dimensions of the elliptical orbit are defined by the maximum (aphelion) and minimum (perihelion) distances of the planet in relation to the Sun. The Sun does not occupy the center of the ellipse, but one of its foci.\n  The dynamic visualization allows understanding that, although the planet travels different distances in equal time intervals, the swept area remains constant, translating in an intuitive way the conservation of angular momentum in orbital motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Observe that, although the planet travels different distances in equal time intervals, the swept area remains constant, translating in an intuitive way the conservation of angular momentum in orbital motion. This means that the planet's velocity varies, being faster at perihelion (near the Sun) and slower at aphelion (far);\n2. Try running the simulation varying the axes \"a\" and \"b\" for Earth. A suggested approximation: 299200000 (major axis) and 299158000 (minor axis) km. If you do not observe anything, click \"Autoscale\" on the top bar;\n3. See that the difference is only 21 thousand km, meaning Earth's orbit is 99.98% \"circular\", although the Sun is displaced from the center.\n\n\n\n\n4.14 Prey-Predator Model (Biology)\n\nBNCC: EM13CNT101, EM13CNT201, EM13CNT204\n  This simulation refers to a population ecology model, the Lotka–Volterra prey–predator model. It is a dynamic system that describes population oscillations caused by ecological interaction between two species: prey - x(t) and predators - y(t). The model considers exponential growth of prey in the absence of predators, reduction of prey by predation encounters and growth of predators proportional to prey availability, with natural mortality of predators.\n  The simulation starts with initial populations (x_0) and (y_0), and evolves in time in discrete steps of size (dt), for (N) iterations.\n  From the computational point of view, the code solves the system numerically by a simple explicit scheme (Euler method), updating (x) and (y) at each step based on the derivatives (dx/dt) and (dy/dt). The animation shows the prey and predator values over time as points in a graph, allowing observing typical patterns of the model, such as population cycles, time lag between prey and predator maxima and sensitivity to parameters and initial conditions.\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\alpha x - \\beta x y\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\delta x y - \\gamma y\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\alpha\\) = prey growth rate;\n\\(\\beta\\) = predation rate per prey–predator encounter;\n\\(\\delta\\) = conversion/production efficiency of predators from predation;\n\\(\\gamma\\) = predator mortality rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Change some script parameters in isolation, and observe the effects on the animation:\n  a. N: no. of points (simulation time)\n  b. Initial prey and predator populations (x and y);\n2. Try changing the predator rate to an extreme value: \"const delta = 0.1\"",

    "text": "5 Simulations\n\n5.1 Vibrating string & sounds\n\nBNCC: EM13CNT101, EM13CNT203, EM13CNT204, EM13CNT206\n  The script implements an interactive simulation of the fundamental frequency and harmonics of a tensioned string, based on the classic model of the ideal vibrating string. The simulation allows exploring how the vibration frequency depends on the string length, the applied tension, the linear mass density and the selected harmonic mode.\n  The graph presents the relationship f(L), that is, frequency as a function of string length, while a highlighted point represents a specific length selected by the user. The simulation includes the tone.js library for sound playback of the verified effect. This allows hearing the corresponding frequency, reinforcing the connection between the physical model, the mathematical representation and auditory perception.\n  Briefly:\n\nThe tension controls the mechanical energy stored in the string;\nThe linear density represents the inertia of the system;\nThe length defines the boundary conditions;\nThe harmonic mode determines the spatial pattern of the wave;\nThe audible frequency connects the physical model to sound perception.\n\n\n\nEquation:\n\nWave speed on the string\n  The propagation speed of a transverse wave on a tensioned string is given by:\n\\[\nv = \\sqrt{\\frac{F}{\\rho}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\nis the wave speed (m·s(^{-1}));\n\n\nis the tension applied to the string (N);\n\n() is the linear mass density of the string (kg·m(^{-1})).\n\n\n\n\nFrequency of the normal modes of vibration\n  For a string fixed at the ends, the frequency of the (n)-th harmonic mode is:\n\\[\nf_n = \\frac{n}{2L}, v\n\\]\n  Substituting the speed expression:\n\\[\nf_n = \\frac{n}{2L}\\sqrt{\\frac{F}{\\rho}}\n\\]\nwhere:\n\nf_n is the frequency of harmonic n (Hz);\nn is the harmonic mode number (n = 1, 2, 3);\nL is the vibrating length of the string (m);\nF is the tension (N);\n\\(\\rho\\) is the linear density (kg·m\\(^{-1}\\)).\n\n\n\n\nFunctional dependence of frequency on length\n  Keeping (F), () and (n) constant, the frequency depends inversely on the string length:\n\\[\nf(L) \\propto \\frac{1}{L}\n\\]\n  This relationship is explicitly explored in the simulation by varying (L) within a defined range.\n\n\nWavelength of harmonics\n  The stationary modes satisfy:\n\\[\n\\lambda_n = \\frac{2L}{n}\n\\]\nwhere (_n) is the wavelength of harmonic (n).\n\n\n5.1.1 Fundamental relation between frequency, speed and wavelength\n\\[\nf_n = \\frac{v}{\\lambda_n}\n\\]\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. Observe the variation of string length in \"L\" on the graph when dragging some slider;\n2. Try clicking the \"automatic sound\" checkbox, and drag some slider;\n3. Observe the effect when changing some of the parameters on the sliders, such as \"F\", \"rho\", and \"harmonic\";\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Chemical reaction kinetics\n\nBNCC: EF09CI07, EM13CNT204, EM13CNT205\n      A topic of uncomfortable assimilation for the student refers to the abstraction necessary to unveil the mathematical relationships that appear in chemical reaction kinetics. When dealing with the conversion of reactants into products, for example, there is an inherent learning barrier regarding reaction rates, inhibition and activation. To reduce the impact of this abstraction, below is an example of an animation for reaction kinetics, and whose object changes as a function of rate options and reaction modulators.\n\n\n\n\nEquation:\n\\[\nR(t)=\\frac{R_0}{1+k_{efetiva}t}\n\\]\n\\[\nP(t)=R_0−R(t)\n\\]\nWhere,\n\n\\(R(t)\\) = amount of reactant R at instant \\(t\\) (arbitrary units);\n\\(P(t)\\) = amount of product P (arbitrary units);\n\\(R_{0}\\) = initial amount of reactant at time \\(t=0\\);\n\\(t\\) = time (in seconds);\n\\(k_{\\text{cinética}}\\) = base rate constant (in \\(s^{-1}\\));\n\\(k_{\\text{efetiva}}\\) = effective constant after considering catalyst and/or inhibitor:\n\n\\[\nk_{\\text{efetiva}} ;=;\nk_{\\text{cinética}} \\times\n\\begin{cases}\nf_{\\text{cat}}, & \\text{if catalyst on}[6pt]\n1, & \\text{if catalyst off}\n\\end{cases}\n\\times\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{1}{f_{\\text{inh}}}, & \\text{if inhibitor on}[6pt]\n1, & \\text{if inhibitor off}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Try changing the constant \"k_cinetica\" at the top of the code (ex.: 0.008, 0.017, 0.05) and use Play/Reset to compare;\n2. Try turning inhibitor and catalyst on/off;\n3. Try changing the strength of the modulators above by editing their constants:\n  a. const fator_catalise  = 2.0; \n  b. const fator_inibicao  = 3.0;",

    "text": "6 Applications\n\n6.1 Drawing board\n\nBNCC: EF15AR06, EF09AR07, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG606\n  Not only of mathematics, graphs and maps does JSPlotly “live”. The example that follows intends to offer a board for drawings, with variation of colors and pen thickness, and geometric shapes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. Explore the script. Although simple, it allows selecting distinct colors, pen thicknesses, and geometric shapes;\n2. As the other objects elaborated in JSPlotly, the board drawing can be stored preserving its interactivity by the \"html\" button, and even modified in the saved file itself (\"play.html\");\n3. If you want to change colors, thicknesses, or want to add other functionalities, check the script variables;\n4. Try the \"clone\" button, which allows cloning the board along with its code. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Gizz - Digital Blackboard\n  The nature of the object below needs no introduction. It is one more among the many applications to simulate a chalkboard, or digital pen board. Different from its competitors, however:\n\nIt can be exported as a self-contained HTML file with a button on the board itself, allowing sharing of the generated image, as well as continuity of its editing;\nIt allows customization of the code that produces it, allowing inserting/changing pens, thicknesses, and distinct actions not foreseen in the source code.\n\n\n\n\n  With respect to its facilities, the digital board allows:\n\nWrite with 7 colors and 3 distinct thicknesses;\nAccess 4 backgrounds of different coloration;\nOverlay the background with a grid;\nUse an eraser (erase);\nUse a laser pointer to locate what one intends to point out;\nSave the image as PNG, indicating date and time;\nSave the image as self-contained HTML (obs: html button on the board; the editor one does not work in this object);\nUndo command (undo) and cleaning (clean) of the board;\nHas keyboard shortcuts: E=eraser; L=laser; Z undo, X clean, H save HTML\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. One can change the thickness of the pens in \"var baseWidth = 1;\" ;\n2. The 1x, 2x, 4x buttons are multipliers; edit the button creation lines to change label/multiplier (ex.: \"addSize('3x', 3, true)\").\n\nObs: the functional button to reproduce the board is the one on the board itself, \"html\". The code editor button does not operate for the application.\n\n\n\n\n6.3 MentMapa - editor for mind map and diagrams\n  In the same line of customizing JSPlotly as done above for the digital board, the program also allows building a diagram or mind map elaborated by mouse clicks, and as an independent application.\n  The Mind Map Editor illustrated in the figure below allows building diverse structures, and fundamentally by combining terms and arrows. There are various functionalities for the facilitated creation of a map or diagram, including a help banner in the upper left corner for several of the actions.\n\n\nInstructions for MentMap\n\n\nCreating terms. Click with the left mouse button and type a term; press Esc to exit;\nDeleting terms. Click Ctrl+right mouse button;\nFrame on terms. Click on a frame on the bar (square, diamond, oval);\nConnecting terms by arrow. Right-click the 1st term, followed by right-click on the 2nd term;\nCurved arrow. Click curve on. Then, right-click the 1st term, followed by left-click on a point between the two terms, and finish with right-click on the 2nd term. To adjust the arrow curvature, click the little ball and drag it to touch a term or an arrow;\nDrag terms and arrows. Just click and drag.\nDrag a group of terms/arrows. Press Shift and draw the area you want to encompass the group with the left mouse button;\nColors for terms and arrows. Select one of the 7 colors available on the top bar, and click an existing term, or a new one. Obs: the arrow color follows that of the terms;\nGrid for more precise positioning. Just click grid on (it is not saved in the final diagram);\nSaving the map (save html). Different from the usual html button, storing the interactive map is done by its own html button, on the icon bar;\nImporting maps (import). The application allows importing an already ready map in json format to continue its editing;\nExporting maps (export). The application also allows exporting the map in json format for future study or simple keeping.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1.

Playing is one thing…creating a game can have a more prominent and recursive impact on computational thinking and logic, as well as on learning the programming language itself!\n\n7.1 Memory Game\n\nBNCC: EF06MA19, EF06MA16, EF07MA26, EF09MA19, EM13MAT401, EM13MAT102, EM13MAT403, EM13LGG701\n  The clickable image below directs to a classic Numeric Memory Game.

One can edit the code for a specific function. For this, just change the line \"var f = function(x){ ... }\". Examples:\n  a. return Math.sin(x*Math.PI/180); (degrees);\n  b. return Math.sin(x); (radians);\n  c. return Math.exp(-0.01*x)*Math.cos(0.2*x);\n2. One can change the scrolling speed of the function by the function below, and whose value is given in milliseconds:\n  \"var PLAY_INTERVAL_MS = 100; \"",

Among the possible libraries, the examples below illustrate the use of tone.js, both for a monophonic instrument (recorder), and for a polyphonic instrument (piano).\n  In parallel to the possibility of editing the code to improve and customize the object, both can be easily used as digital musical instruments standalone, since they can be exported by the “html” button preserving their interactivity by mouse or touch on capacitive screens of mobile devices.\n\n9.1 FlautaDoce\n\nBNCC: EF15AR05, EF69AR09, EM13LGG601, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG701\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1. The recorder was conceived for tones (circle) and semitones (semicircles). You can \"play\" the recorder by clicking with the left mouse button on a hole or using your finger on a smartphone;\n2. You can add or omit some hole in the recorder, just by changing the two lines of the variables \"var naturais\" and \"var sustenidos\";\n2. You can turn your recorder into a \"pífano\", generally higher than the recorder, and quite common in northeastern tradition. For this, just replace the lines of the variables \"var naturais\" and \"var sustenidos\", changing the value of \"5\" to \"6\", as follows (add \"add\" afterwards - or \"clean\"/\"add\"):\n    var naturais   = [\"C6\",\"D6\",\"E6\",\"F6\",\"G6\",\"A6\",\"B6\"];\n    var sustenidos = [\"C#6\",\"D#6\",\"F6\",\"F#6\",\"G#6\",\"A#6\",\"B6\"];\n3. In the reasoning line above, it is also possible to change the recorder pattern, low recorders and contrabass. For example, a German recorder (larger hole, soprano, used in Schools and represented in the script) or Baroque (smaller hole, lower tones).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2 Piano\n\nBNCC: F15AR05, EF69AR09, EM13LGG601, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG701\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion\n\n1.

To prolong the sound of the keys raise the \"sustain\" bar;\n3. As part of JSPlotly, the piano can be shared without the code, only as an instrument for music education or practice, since it is exported by the \"html\" button, preserving its interactivity and sonority by mouse or finger touch on a mobile device;\n4.

However, it is possible to integrate it with different interfaces for acquiring real-world data. The following example illustrates as a target the response for an accelerometer, a positioning sensor of a mobile device (accelerometer).\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As the app is for the \"x, y and z\" positioning of a mobile device, try changing the position of your phone/tablet in space.\n\n\n\n\n11.2 Arduino - Conductivity data acquisition\n\nBNCC: EM13CNT201, EM13CNT308, M13CNT301, M13CNT302\n  The example below illustrates an application for real-time acquisition/control by browser for using an Arduino or ESP32 board, exponentially raising the application of JSPlotly for real experimentation and experimental STEAM projects.\n  The setup presents a data reading of conductivity in aqueous solution containing increasing NaCl contents (0 to 5% w/v). An Arduino Uno R3 board was used with Web Serial connection by USB to a notebook running an autonomous application for JSPlotly. Conductivity was obtained by a commercial TDS sensor (total dissolved solids) with excitation by square-wave alternating potential (PWM) to minimize polarization effects, and script adapted from the manufacturer. The TDS sensor operates in the range of 3.3 to 5.0 V (input) with output of 0 to 2.3 V, and current of 3 to 6 mA.\n\n\n Example of JSPlotly application to interface with Arduino. The graph shows conductivity measurements in aqueous medium with a TDS meter for increasing NaCl contents (probe in the left corner). Click the image to obtain the standalone JSPlotly application for conductivity.\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor Web Serial connection it is necessary to install Python on the computer (Windows or Linux), and setup of a local server. For Windows download and install the official file for Python, remembering to click Add Python to PATH, and type the commands in CMD inside the standalone application folder. Below is the guidance for Linux:\n\n\n\nConnect the Arduino and components (TDS probe, container with water and salt);\n\n\nCopy, paste and run the distributor’s script for TDS on the connected Arduino IDE (example 1, example 2 );\n\n\nClose the Arduino IDE;\n\n\nOpen a Terminal in the standalone application folder of JSPlotly for Arduino (condutiv_JSPlotly.html);\n\n\nType: python3 -m http.server\n\n\nOpen the standalone circuit html in Chrome (never in Firefox);\n\n\n  The reading should start in moments. If it does not, check whether the transfer rate for the Arduino IDE matches that of the application (115200 baud).\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion:\n\n1. As the app is written in JSPlotly, it is possible to customize it for various situations, such as data transfer rate, traces (type, colors, thickness), chart type, among others.",

To reduce these emissions, it is necessary to transform the current energy matrix, industry, and food systems.\n\n\nTo understand CO\\(_{2}\\) emissions in Brazil from 1890 to 2022, run the following code snippet in an R script (i.e., copy, paste, and run) from the source Our World in Data.\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(readr) # data import library\nlibrary(dplyr) # library for using the pipe operator \"%&gt;%\"\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Loading data from the internet\nurl &lt;- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv\"\nco2_data &lt;- read.csv(url)\n\n# Filtering data for Brazil using subset()\nco2_brasil &lt;- subset(co2_data, country == \"Brazil\")\n\n# Creating an interactive graph with plot_ly\nco2_plot &lt;- plot_ly(data = co2_brasil, x = ~year, y = ~co2, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines+markers') %&gt;%\nlayout(title = \"CO2 emissions in Brazil over the years\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"Year\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"CO2 emissions (million tons)\"))\n\nNow, the icing on the cake.

The slider can be useful when you want to focus on a specific region of the graph. For example, to adjust CO₂ emissions for the last few years.\n\n1.1.1 Adding a drop-down menu\nDropdown menus allow you to view a different graph for each option selected. To illustrate this interactive feature, let’s first create a dataset that has linear, quadratic, and cubic responses to an independent variable, as follows:\n\nx = 1:10 # vector of the independent variable \"x\"\nyLin = x\nyQuad = x^2 # creation of the quadratic dependent variable \nyCub = x^3 # creation of the cubic dependent variable \n\ndatLQC &lt;-data.frame(x,yLin,yQuad,yCub) # creation of the data sheet\n\nNow we can insert the dropdown menu for selecting mathematical trends:\n\nplot_ly(datLQC, x = ~x, y = ~yLin, type = \"scatter\", mode = \"line\", name = \"Linear\") %&gt;%\n  add_trace(x = ~x, y = ~yQuad, mode = \"line\", name = \"Quadrático\") %&gt;%\n  add_trace(x = ~x, y = ~yCub, mode = \"line\", name = \"Cúbico\") %&gt;%\n  layout(\n    title = \"Gráficos de potência\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"x\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"x^n\"),\n    updatemenus = list(\n      list(\n        buttons = list(\n          list(label = \"yLin\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)))),\n          list(label = \"yQuad\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)))),\n          list(label = \"yCub\", method = \"update\", args = list(list(visible = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE))))\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough you may find the code snippet above a little complicated, just copy it, paste it into a script, and run it. This exemplifies the essence inherent in Reproducible Teaching, from the simple reproduction of code to its alteration and even the creation of new code. If you are curious, you can change some terms in the code above, such as the labels (label, replace a name, for example) that appear in the drop-down menu, the type of graph you want (replace scatter with bar, for example), or the title of the graph (title).\n\n\nIn terms of interactivity, the selection of the type of power to be represented by the drop-down menu is added to those already present in the plot_ly command.\n\n\nAs with many R packages, there are a significant number of commands and interactive widgets with plotly, which, in this specific case, would provide enough material for a separate book. However, you can consult numerous websites about plotly for more comprehensive learning, the links below, and even a free online book with related codes and graphics. To see the immense wealth of interactive graphics, take a look at the plotly website (https://plotly.com/r/) for R.\n\n\n\nGeneral\nManual\nTutorial"

    "text": "2 Molecular characteristics\nThere is a lot of tangible information about a molecular model in Jmol. Here are some examples of the most basic information for the molecule of a component of shoyo sauce, glutamate:\n\n2.1 Charges\nSometimes it can be interesting to show the polarity of molecules based on their charge distribution. In Jmol there are two types of charges, effective charge (formaCharge) and partial charge (partialcharge). We can illustrate the charge distribution in a surfactant molecule, such as hexadecanoate.\n\n\n\nExample of a 16-carbon surfactant, hexadecenoic acid. Source: MAPA: high school - 3rd semester, 3rd year, p.63. Natural sciences and their technologies.\n\n\nTo do this, type the following commands in the Console:\n\nload $hexadecanoate\ncalculate partialCharge # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %P # presentation of charges (labeling)\n\nA feature of Jmol that makes it more efficient to execute actions is the sequential arrangement of commands. This way, it is not necessary to click Enter for each command, just separate the commands with semicolons (;) as illustrated below, to calculate the partial charges of the glutamate molecule:\n\n\n\nPresentation of partial charges in the glutamate model, a component of Shoyo sauce, also illustrating a sequence of actions in Jmol.\n\n\nSimilarly, the obtaining of formal charges in the model can be illustrated. In this case, transparent coloring was added for better visualization of the negative unit charge of the carboxylic acid:\n\ncalculate formalcharges # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %C # presentation of charges (labeling)\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the commands in sequence for viewing formal charges in the glutamate molecule.\n\n\nNote that the commands in the figure mix upper and lower case letters, unlike the command line that precedes them. This is a cool feature of Jmol, which does not care about font capitalization. In other words, it does not matter if you use lower case, upper case, or a combination of both; Jmol performs the action in the same way.\n\n2.1.1 Scripts & Reproducible Teaching\nThe example above shows a simple way to concatenate commands, facilitating the automatic and sequential execution of a set of them. However, the command line view is somewhat impaired by the separation with “;”, which can cause visual pollution when there are several commands.\nThe workaround involves arranging the commands in a script format. This is nothing more than a piece of code containing one command per line, which improves the visualization of the code as a whole. In addition, the script has the added advantage of allowing comments to be inserted between command lines, also allowing for better appropriation of the code and its learning.\nThese characteristics of a command line with explanatory comments give Jmol its aspect for programming sequential actions, and consequently establish one of the basic premises for Reproducible Teaching: the writing of code snippets in single-line commands, written as in a notepad, with comments on the program’s actions on each line.\nAs an example for a script involving the actions for glutamate above, just copy the snippet below and paste it into the JSmol Console, then execute it.\n\nload $glu # loading micromolecule \nwireframe only # exclusive rendering of rods\ncalculate partialCharge # partial charge\nlabel %P \n\nAnother aspect inherent to the Reproducible Teaching initiative is the possibility of evaluating the code with some changes, aiming at a slightly modified final product. Try repeating the above snippet, but for effective charges, that is:\n\nload $glu # loading micromolecule \ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\ncalculate formalCharge # effective charge \nlabel %C \n\nIn addition, you can change more commands in the code to create a result that is completely different from the original. This defines another feature of Reproducible Teaching, namely code snippet creation. To illustrate, here is an excerpt based on the previous one, but for energy minimization and restructuring of the molecule’s orbitals.\n\nload $glu # micromolecule loading \ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\nminimize # command for structure energy minimization"

    "text": "Gráficos 3D\n      Para encerrar essa parte, gráficos tridimensionais ! A versão básica de um gráfico 3D é bem simples de se executar no plotly, e seu efeito visual e de interatividade são bem expressivos !\n      Um exemplo de gráfico 3D pode ser obtido das relações de raio, área superficial, e volume de uma esfera, tal como segue.\n\n\n\nRelações matemáticas de área superficial e de volume de uma esfera em função de seu raio. Fonte: MAPA: ensino médio - Matemática e suas tecnologias. 1º Bim. 3º Ano, p.15.\n\n\n      Agora vamos elaborar o gráfico 3D interativo no plotly. O mais simples seria com as etiquetas com os nomes padrão, x, y e z. Mas é melhor acrescentar o comando layout para dar significado físico e melhorar a interpretação do gráfico.\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Dados:\nr = seq(0,100, length.out = 50)\nAreaSup = 4*pi*r^2 # cálculo de área superficial da esfera\nVolume = 4/3*pi*r^3 # cálculo do volume da esfera\n\n# Gráfico:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = r, y = AreaSup, z = Volume, \n        mode= 'markers+lines')%&gt;%\n  layout(scene = list(\n         xaxis=list(title=\"raio\"),\n         yaxis=list(title=\"área superficial\"),\n         zaxis=list(title=\"volume\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Observe que o gráfico é interativo também sobre outros aspectos, como sua rotação em qualquer dos 3 eixos. Sob o ponto de vista de conteúdo, esse gráfico ilustra como que os valores de área superficial, e mais ainda de volume, são enormemente variados em função do raio de uma esfera. Isso também justifica em parte o grande sucesso do uso de nanopartículas em Ciência e Tecnologia nos dias atuais (alta área de superfície em tamanho reduzido).\n      Outro gráfico tridimensional interessante é o de superfície 3D. Como o de cima, poucas linhas são necessárias para defini-lo. A diferença é que você pode trabalhar com uma equação,para a superfície, veja:\n\nx &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 50)\ny &lt;- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 50)\nz &lt;- outer(x, y, function(x, y) x^2 - y^2) # equação x^2+y^2\n\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~y, z = ~z, type = 'surface') %&gt;%\n  layout(title = \"Gráfico de Superfície\")\n\n\n\n\n\n      Existem outros tipos de gráficos para o plotly, pelo que vale uma visitinha ao website para mais informações."

    "section": "1 Creating an interactive graph",
    "text": "1 Creating an interactive graph\nLet’s start by creating the data from an equation applied to a vector. To do this, we need…the vector! Think of a vector as a column (or row) in Excel. In R, vectors are created by concatenating values separated by commas, as follows:\n\nx = c(1,2,3,4,5) # a vector; the \"c\" indicates \"concatenation\"\n# assigns values from 1 to 5 to the variable \"x\"\n\n# Alternatively,\n\nx = 1:5 # also assigns values from 1 to 5 to the variable \"x\"\n\nTo create the interactive graph, let’s illustrate the vertical launch equation below. This image, as well as the others used to illustrate the potential use of R & RStudio in basic education, were extracted from the notebooks of MAPA (Educational Support Material for Learning in Minas Gerais.\n\n\nNow we will make an interactive graph from this data. But first, of course, you need to install the plotly package in R. You can install it from the Packages tab in RStudio, if you haven’t already, and as explained in the previous section on Packages.\n\n\nFinal step… build a scatter plot of the vertical rise function.\nTo do this, simply copy the snippet below and paste it into a new R script. Then run it in any of the ways mentioned in the previous section.\n\n\n\n# Data:\nt = 1:20 # defines the time vector\nVo = 100 # initial velocity, 100 m/s\ng = 9.8 # acceleration due to gravity, m/s^2\n\n# Equation (vertical rise):\n\nH = Vo*t-1/2*g*t^2\n\n# Interactive graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = ~t, y = ~H)\n\n\n\n\n# Note:\n# Plotly syntax: ~variable, to assign a variable (x or y)\n# type: to assign a graph type\n\nR usually displays some messages (Warnings) after running the commands. These are not errors, but additional information, such as in the reproduction of the previous graph. In this case, the information is that the type of graph is missing, a scatter plot:\n\nplot_ly(x = t, y = H, type = 'scatter')\n\nNow observe how much interactivity has emerged with the simple command above, by moving the mouse over the points on the graph, or by clicking on the icons that appeared above the graph. Test this interactivity:\n\nHovering the mouse over the points on the graph will give you the coordinates of each point;\nUsing the mouse scroll wheel will zoom in or out on the graph\nLeft-clicking anywhere on the graph and drawing a rectangle will zoom in on that area;\nDouble-clicking after zooming in will return you to the original graph;\nPositioning the mouse pointer between the values of an axis and dragging the mouse will cause the selected axis to shift;\nBy selecting an icon in the upper right corner of the graph, you can, in sequence from the left, download the plot as an image, zoom in, move the axes, select points within a box or within a loop, zoom in, zoom out, scale to the original size, realign the axes to those of the original plot, view the coordinates (x and y), view only the y coordinate, and return to the beginning."

    "text": "3 Working with mathematical relationships in variables\nWhen constructing a graph, it is sometimes useful to be able to perform a calculation on a variable without having to create a new vector. Let’s illustrate this with an isothermal transformation in the study of gases (Boyle-Mariotte’s law), as follows:\n\n\n\nRelationship between pressure and volume in an isothermal transformation. Source: MAPA: high school - Natural sciences and their technologies. 2nd semester. 3rd year, p.28.\n\n\nFor example, if you are working in a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel) and want to build a graph of the above relationship, say V versus p, you will have to set up a column with this operation. In plotly, as in R as a whole, this is not necessary, since p can be considered as a constant 1/V. In fact, this constant is represented by the general constant of ideal gases, R, of known value.\nSolving for the above situation:\n\n# Data:\nR = 8.314 # J/(mol*K), general constant of ideal gases\nV = seq(0.224, length.out=50) # vector of \"Volume\" (in liters), with 50 points\nT = 298 # K, absolute temperature\n\n\n# Equation\n# pV = RT; p = RT/V\np = R*T/V\n\n# Graph:\nlibrary(plotly)\nplot_ly(x = V, y = ~R*T/V, type = 'scatter', mode='lines')\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you want to name the axis labels and give the graph a title to better convey the physical meaning of the quantities involved, just add the layout command as follows:\n\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(magrittr) # library for the pipe operator \"%&gt;%\"\nplot_ly(x = V, y = ~R*T/V, type = \"scatter\", mode=\"lines\") %&gt;%\nlayout(\ntitle = \"Isothermal Transformation of a Gas\",\nxaxis = list(title = \"Volume V, L\"),\nyaxis = list(title = \"Pressure p, bar\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s your turn:\nOpen a new script and build a graph that shows any relationship between variables, as suggested below:\n\nCreate the values of the independent variable (e.g., x = 1:10);\n\nLoad the plotly library - library(plotly) ;\n\nEnter a general command line for the graph:\nplot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~sqrt(x), type = \"scatter\")\n\nSelect these lines, press Ctrl+Enter, and observe the output (i.e., the graph, in the plots tab;\n\nModify the “y” variable, replacing the value of “x” with some other relationship, such as: ~exp(x) - exponential, ~sin(10*x) - sine, ~sqrt(x)` - square root;"

    "section": "2 Life expectancy & Gross Domestic Product",
    "text": "2 Life expectancy & Gross Domestic Product\nA very interesting use of plot_ly in graphic animation is when we need to present various data on a given topic. This is called multivariate data. To illustrate this situation, let’s say we want to provide various information in a graph showing the relationship between a country’s gross domestic product and the life expectancy of its inhabitants over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome economic indicators associated with life expectancy in 2001. Source: MAPA: high school - Human sciences and their technologies. 1st semester, 2nd year, p.101.\n\n\nTo illustrate the interactive richness that can be obtained by plotly on the influence of gross domestic product - GDP on life expectancy, we can import a data set from the internet and create a graph on this relationship, see:\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Obtaining data from the internet\nurl &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpVida &lt;- url # assigning the data to an `R` object\n\n# Creating the interactive graph\nplot_ly(\ndadosExpVida, # data converted from the internet\nx = ~gdpPercap, # name of the per capita income column in the data\ny = ~lifeExp, # name of the life expectancy column in the data\ntype = 'scatter', # graph type (scatter)\nmode = 'markers' # scatter type (points)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDone! Simple, straightforward, and interactive code. If you hover your mouse over the points, you will see the coordinates of GDP and life expectancy. However, it is not possible to tell from this graph who is who, i.e., which country has which GDP, as well as other information contained in the original spreadsheet downloaded from the internet. To give you an idea, this spreadsheet contains, in addition to GDP and life expectancy values, the country and its population, the continent to which it belongs, as well as the year the data was measured.\n\n\nThus, we are faced with a set of multivariate data, which is very common in various databases, such as IBGE or DATASUS.\n\n\nHow about if we could present everything at once, i.e., GDP, life expectancy, the country, the size of the population, the continent, and the year in which all of this was measured, i.e., six variables, including numerical and categorical (classes) variables?\n\n\nImpossible?! Not for R!! Here is a snippet of code for that, with the proposed result. Don’t worry about the size or details. If you want to reproduce this code, you know what to do… just copy, paste, and run the code in an R script.\n\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Obtendo os dados na internet\nurl &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kirenz/datasets/refs/heads/master/gapminder.csv\")\n\ndadosExpVida &lt;- url  # atribuindo os dados a um objeto do `R`\n\n# Criando o gráfico interativo com animação\nplot_ly(\n  dadosExpVida, # dados convertidos da internet\n  x = ~gdpPercap, # renda per capita\n  y = ~lifeExp, # expectativa de vida\n  size = ~pop, # tamanho dos pontos em função da população\n  color = ~country, # cor dos pontos em função do país\n  frame = ~year,    # Frame para a animação por ano de coleta dos dados\n  text = ~continent,  # País como informação ao passar o mouse\n  hoverinfo = \"text\",\n  type = 'scatter', # tipo de gráfico\n  mode = 'markers',\n  marker = list(sizemode = 'diameter', opacity = 0.7)\n) %&gt;%\n  layout(  # atribuição de título e etiquetas dos eixos\n    title = \"Produto interno bruto X Expectativa de vida\",\n    xaxis = list(title = \"PIB (log), US$\", type = \"log\"),\n    yaxis = list(title = \"Expectativa de Vida, anos\"),\n    showlegend = TRUE # possibilidade ou não de aparecer a legenda\n  ) %&gt;%\n  animation_opts(\n    frame = 1000,           # Velocidade da animação\n    transition = 0,\n    redraw = TRUE\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo go to the “playground” now, click PLAY and observe the temporal transition of life expectancy as a function of countries’ GDP. And note that all other data is there, separated by point size (population), color (country), continent (hover, mouse over), and year (animation frame or frame)!\n\n\nOne more detail! If you look at the legend, you will see that it is also sliding, identifying each country by color. Want to know where Brazil is in this crazy graph of GDP and life expectancy? Easy. Find Brazil in the legend, double-click, and notice that now only that point is highlighted."

On the other hand, with the cloud version, it is not necessary to install either R or RStudio, while with the installed version there are a few steps to do this, described below.\n\n\nHowever, you can use the cloud version throughout the Course, without having to worry about installing R or RStudio."

Among some advantages, the speed is usually higher for running and installing packages, since the server is already in the cloud. But because it is online, it requires an initial registration with a login and password. Follow these steps:\n\n\n\nAccess the RStudio Cloud.\n\n\n\nSign up or log in with Google (simpler).\nThe window should look like the one below, although without the projects listed.\n\n\n\nNow for the interesting part. Click on New Project and select New Rstudio Project.\n\n\n\nThe final image will be very similar to the one shown by the installed version, see:\n\n\n\nDone! You can use either method to access the proposed activities. Below are some quick actions and commands for working with the Rstudio interface and R. However, these are only for creating, executing, and modifying some scripts created for interactivity through animation, simulation, and cartographic visualization.\n\n\nLet’s get started!"

    "text": "In parallel with the numerical solution of multiple equations (program Site1), a broad range of scientific problems involves rates of change of one or more quantities with respect to one or more independent variables—situations naturally described by differential equations. When a single independent variable is involved (typically time), these derivatives are referred to as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Solving an initial value problem for an ODE is commonly done through numerical approximation schemes, among which the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg method is widely known. The kinSite program uses the calculator’s internal ODE solver (RKF) to model the kinetics of molecular interaction."
