To get the most out of each topic, try following the suggestions for *parametric manipulation* in each topic.\n \n\\\n\n## Instructions {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Choose a topic;\n2. Click on the corresponding graph;\n3. Click on \"Add Plot\";\n4. Use the mouse for interactivity and/or edit the code. \n\nReminder: the editor uses infinite undo/redo in the code (Ctrl+Z / Shift+Ctrl+Z)!\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\n## Mathematics\n\n###  Trigonometry (EM13MAT306, EM13MAT308, EM13MAT307) \n\n| The following simulation aims to facilitate the visualization of some concepts in trigonometry, *sine, cosine, and tangent*. The code allows you to use a *drop-down menu* for each trigonometric function, as well as a *slider* to change the frequency in radians.\n \n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n**1. Sine function:** \n\n$$\ny = \\sin(\\omega x)\n$$\n\n**2. Cosine function:**\n\n$$\ny = \\cos(\\omega x)\n$$\n\n**3. Tangent function:**\n\n$$\ny = \\tan(\\omega x)\n$$\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/trigonom.png)](Eq/jsp_trigonom2.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Select the sine, cosine, and tangent functions alternately using the \"drop-down menu\";\n2. Try changing the frequency of the function using the slider;\n3. Overlay a sine graph and a cosine graph to observe their differences;\n4. Repeat the same for the tangent graph.\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n###  Use of selector and buttons in data fluctuation (EF07MA21, EF07GE04, EM13MAT301, EM13CHS104, EM13CNT103)\n\n| A button accesses a specific situation, while a selector allows you to enlarge a specific area of values, highlighting graphical information for a function or significant fluctuations. Both are illustrated below in a simulation for temporal fluctuation of values (expressed as a sine wave modified by random increments). \n\n[![](Eq/mat_seletor.png) ](Eq/mat_seletor.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Drag the end markers of the graph to view a more restricted limit;\n2. Click on the buttons with different periods;\n2. You can change the random noise around the mathematical equation that defines the fluctuation above by simply modifying the line of code in: \"const values = days.map((_, i) => 50 + 10 * Math.sin(i / 10) + Math.random() * 50);\" - change ‘50’ to \"5\".\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n\n\n###  Simulated animation for a function (EF07MA20, EF09MA20, EM13MAT302, EM13MAT304)\n\n| With the application, it is possible to simulate a frame-by-frame animation to improve learning of a topic by inserting a manual slider. The following example shows a *simulator for manual animation* for mathematical functions. To use it, simply slide the *slider* progressively to see a graphical representation of the result as the predictor variable changes.\n\n**Note: ** This educational object has a trick...actually, two! After clicking *add*, you must first slide the *slider* to view the graph. And to view an animation for another equation, you must refresh the page, as instructed at the bottom of the graphic screen.\n\n\n[![](Eq/anima.png)](Eq/jsp_anima2.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Slide the control to highlight the manual animation;\n2. Try replacing the model equation with another one, and drag the slider to observe the effect;\n3. Change some parameters for the animation, for example, increasing the \"frames\" levels (slider.max = \"50\"; slider.value = 1);\n4. Reload the page and change the mathematical function; e.g., \"let f = x => Math.sin(x);\"\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n###  Simulated animation with multiple sliders\n\n| Simpler and more immediate than code changes, sliders can contribute more immediately to the understanding of a problem, as follows for the example of the parameters of a parabola.\n\n\n[![](Eq/mat_slider_parab.png)](Eq/mat_slider_parab.html){target= \"_blank\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Drag any slider and observe the trend presented, as well as the change in the equation parameters at the top;\n2. As in the previous example, it is possible to change the mathematical function in the code, as well as the parameters for a new slider. Test this by changing the function \" y_values = x_values.map(x => a * x * x + b * x + c);\n\" to \" y_values = x_values.map(x => Math.sin(a * x * x + b * x + c));\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n###  Fractal composition (EM13MAT301, EM13MAT305, EM13MAT401, EM13ARM502, EF09MA10)\n\n\n| Fractals are geometric objects with scale symmetry, forming patterns that repeat in smaller parts of the original object. The most common mathematical representations are Mandelbrot fractals and Julia fractals, which combine art and mathematics in geometric figures with fractional dimensions that express the degree of complexity and space occupation. Originally conceived at IBM in the 1980s, fractals are now seen everywhere from the cartographic outline of certain regions to the distribution of living cells in culture.\n\n\n### Equation {.unnumbered}\n\n| Julia fractals are formed in a complex Cartesian plane by the sum of the real and imaginary components. The basic formula for the Julia set is given by:\n\n$$\nz_{n+1}=z_{n}^{2}+c\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- z ∈ C: usually initialized as the point on the complex plane;\n\n- c ∈ C: fixed for each Julia set.\n\n\n[![](Eq/julia.png)](Eq/jsp_julia2.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.

The following example adds this fractal with a selection menu.\n\n[![](Eq/fractal_mandel.png)](Eq/fractal_mandel.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Select different colors and magnification levels (\"zoom\") in the two menus for different views;\n2. Check where the equations that define the Mandelbrot profile are located in the code, and make small changes to check different results.\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n## Financial Mathematics\n\n###  Compound Interest (EM13MAT402):\n\n| Also known by the maxim *\"interest on interest,\"* compound interest adds value to capital over time, resulting in growth of the final amount. \n\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\nM = C \\cdot (1 + i)^t\n$$\n\n\n*Where,*\n\n- M: final amount\n- C: initial capital\n- i: interest rate per period (in decimal)\n- t: number of periods (e.g., months)\n\n[![](Eq/juros.png)](Eq/jsp_juros2.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Vary the contract period, monthly interest rate, or initial amount.\n2. Try combining the parameters in the variation.\n3. Evaluate the visual difference between an investment and a loan, entering a positive initial capital value for the former and a negative value for the latter.\n \n4. Observe the downward curve for a simulated loan with negative initial capital. The remaining values refer to the outstanding debt to pay off the loan.\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n## Statistics\n\n###  Normal distribution curve (EM13MAT316, EM13MAT407, EM13MAT312) \n\n\n| Sampling and population are common topics for data observation in analytical procedures. The statistical distribution curves for this involve the *t-Student*, *F-Snedecor*, *Chi-square*, and *normal distribution*. The normal distribution curve reflects the statistical behavior for natural phenomena in a given data population.\n\n| The example aims to illustrate the use of the z-transformation, the calculation of critical values, and the interpretation of the area under the curve in the study of normal distribution and statistical inference.\n\n### Equation {.unnumbered}\n\n| The density function of the normal (or Gaussian) distribution is given below?\n\n\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\, e^{ -\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} }\n$$\n\n\n*Where:*\n\n- $\\mu$ = 0 (mean of the distribution);\n- $\\sigma$ = 1 (standard deviation);\n- *x* = continuous random variable;\n*f* = density function of the normal distribution\n\n\n| From the above equation, we can extract *z*, the value of the standardized random variable for zero mean and unit standard deviation, representing the value on the x-axis:\n\n\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n$$\n\n\n\n[![](Eq/estat.png)](Eq/jsp_estat2.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Try changing the value of \"p\" and run the graph. This value represents the probability of observing, under the null hypothesis, a value as extreme or more extreme than the observed value — that is, it measures the evidence against the null hypothesis. In the graph, it represents the area under the normal curve in the critical regions, indicating the chance of the observed result occurring by pure chance.\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n\n###  Animation of a histogram (EF09MA21, EM13MAT406, EM13MAT407)\n\n| Statistical information is sometimes represented graphically, such as the distribution of values in box-and-whisker plots or histograms. The example below illustrates the potential for understanding a histogram added to an animation feature. \n\\\n\n\n[!

Test other tones (C, G, D, etc.), observing how the pure wave appears by superimposing the graphs;\n2. Evaluate the difference between a pure wave and one produced with musical instruments, involving natural harmonics. To do this, replace the Boolean option from \"false\" to ‘true’ in the variable \"const ondaComposta\".\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n\n###  Elastic potential energy (EM13CNT102, EM13CNT202, EM13MAT402)\n\n| The deformation of an elastic material is directly proportional to the force exerted on it and limited to the properties of the material.\n\n### Equation {.unnumbered}\n\n| The behavior of an ideal spring is described by Hooke's Law below:\n\n\n\n$$\nF = -k*x\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- F = restoring force of the spring (N);\n- k = elastic constant of the spring (N/m);\n- x = deformation (m).\n\n| On the other hand, the *elastic potential energy* involved is described by the following quadratic relationship:\n\n$$\nE = \\frac{1}{2}*k*x^2\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n- E = elastic potential energy (J).\n\n[![](Eq/fisica2.png)](Eq/jsp_fisica2.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.

Note that there is a slider bar for initial angles in the simulation. Drag the bar to another angle and add the graph, comparing the effect of this modification.\n2. Change the initial velocity in the code and observe the effect on the graph.\n3. Simulate a \" lunar condition\" for the trajectory, whose gravity is around 1/6 that of Earth (~1.6 m/s²).\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n\n###  Animation for oblique launch (EF09CI09, EF09MA20, EM13CNT103, EM13MAT304)\n\n| Like simulations, animations can aid in understanding a specific topic (*simulation- or animation-based learning*). *JSPlotly* can work directly with animations using the *Plotly.js* library (insertion of *frames*, *buttons*, *transitions*, for example).\n\n| Below is an animation for the parabolic launch of a projectile, described by the equations in the previous topic. Unlike that one, however, the insertion of an animation adds value to the understanding of the phenomenon by offering the possibility of *parametric manipulation* of the code associated with the animation itself.\n\\\n\n\n[![](Eq/lancamento.png)](Eq/lancamento.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.

Note that the image was made possible by \"zoom\" on the graphic screen, to improve the visualization of the planets. In this sense, try using this feature during the animation; \n2. Note that there are 8 planets in the animation, not including the dwarf planet Pluto. This is not because it has been overlooked, but because you can observe how slow the planets move as they distance themselves from the Sun (see Neptune, which is practically static). In this sense, we can see the potential of an animation with approximate data, providing additional information that is not noticeable in textbooks on the subject.\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n###  Animation for simple harmonic motion (EF09CI09, EF09MA18, EM13CNT104, EM13CNT203)\n\n| Among various situations for analyzing the physical properties of materials and systems, the linear relationship between applied mass and spring deformation is of significant importance.

If you find that the game is too difficult or too easy, you can change the size of the paddle in \"paddle = { w: 80, h: 10,...\";\n3. If you want to increase the game area, modify the line below (width, height):\n\"var cv = sk.createCanvas(400, 300).parent(‘gameArea’);\"\n```\n:::\n\n\\\n\n##  Experimental Interface\n\n### JSPlotly for Arduino and conductivity data acquisition (EM13CNT201, EM13CNT308, M13CNT301, M13CNT302) {.unnumbered}\n\n| *JSPlotly* was initially designed for the construction of interactive *virtual learning objects*. However, it can be integrated into an interface for microcontroller boards (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi), exponentially increasing its application for real experimentation and *experimental STEAM projects*.\n \n\n| The example below illustrates an application for real-time acquisition/control via a browser. The setup presents a conductivity data reading in an aqueous solution containing increasing levels of NaCl (0 to 5% w/v). An Arduino Uno R3 board with a Web Serial connection via USB to a notebook running a standalone application for JSPlotly was used. Conductivity was obtained by a commercial TDS (total dissolved solids) sensor with square wave alternating potential (PWM) excitation to minimize polarization effects, and a script adapted from the manufacturer. The TDS sensor operates in the range of 3.3 to 5.0 V (input) with an output of 0 to 2.3 V and a current of 3 to 6 mA.\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/arduino.png)](Eq/condutiv_JSPlotly.html){target=“_blank”}\n*Example of JSPlotly application for interfacing with Arduino. The graph shows conductivity measurements in aqueous medium with a TDS meter for increasing NaCl contents (probe in the left corner). Click on the image to get the standalone JSPlotly application for conductivity.*\n\\\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. For *Web Serial* connection, you need to install *Python* on your computer (Windows or Linux) and set up a local server. For Windows, download and install the official file for [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), remembering to click on *Add Python to PATH*, and type the commands in CMD inside the standalone application folder. Here are the instructions for Linux:\n\n- 1. Connect the Arduino and components (TDS probe, container with water and salt);\n- 2. Copy, paste, and run the manufacturer's *script* for TDS in the connected Arduino IDE;\n- 3. Close the Arduino IDE;\n- 4. Open a Terminal in the standalone application folder of *JSPlotly* for Arduino (*condutiv_JSPlotly.html*);\n- 5. Type: *python3 -m http.server*\n- 6. Open the standalone html of the circuit in Chrome (never in Firefox);\n\n| The reading should start in a few moments. If it does not, check that the transfer rate to the Arduino IDE matches that of the application (115200 bauds).\n\\\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Since the application is written in JSPlotly, it can be customized for various situations, such as data transfer rate, lines (type, colors, thickness), chart type, among others. \n```\n:::\n\n\\",
