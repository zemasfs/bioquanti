The titration equation refers to a *triprotic acid*, the phosphoric acid of the buffer of the same name, but it would also apply to many others, such as those present in the Krebs cycle (citrate, isocitrate). \n\n\n#### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\nfa= \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa1 - pH}} + \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa2 - pH}} + \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa3 - pH}}\n$$\n*Where*,\nfa = fraction of acid (protonatable groups)\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/tit_acbase.png)](Eq/jsp_acbase.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n<!---div class=\"jsplotly_sup-fundo\"> --->\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r, eval =FALSE}\n\"A.

After clicking on the related image below, click on \"add\" and observe the acid-base titration graph generated. The abscissa axis (x-axis) has a wide range of pH values, and the y-axis shows the charge that the molecule with ionization potential manifests at each pH, as a function of its pKa value;\n\n2. Click on \"Animate\" to observe the displacement of a small ball along the titration curve, up to a pH value predefined in the simulator script, and as a function of its pKa;\n\n3. Modify the type of ionizable group (in \"let grupo_edit = \"*) and/or the desired final pH (\"let pH_final_edit = \"*) in the script to evaluate the ionization state of a new group;\n\n4.

Positive values indicate a hydrophobic tendency (e.g., Ile, Val, Leu), and negative values indicate a hydrophilic tendency (e.g., Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg). The index allows us to highlight sections prone to nonpolar environments, as well as regions exposed to the aqueous solvent.\n\n\n\n### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\n\\tilde{y}_i \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{w} \\sum_{k=i-m}^{i+m} y_k,\n\\qquad w = 2m+1\n$$\n\\\n\n*Where*,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &:\\; \\text{hydrophobicity value at position $i$ of the sequence} \\\\\n\\tilde{y}_i &:\\; \\text{smoothed value (moving average) at position $i$} \\\\\nm &:\\; \\text{half-window (number of neighbors on each side)} \\\\\nw &:\\; \\text{total window width ($w=2m+1$)} \\\\\ni &:\\; \\text{position of the amino acid in the sequence ($1 \\leq i \\leq N$)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\n[![](Eq/hidrofob.png)](Eq/jsp_hidrofob.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r,eval=FALSE}\n1.

The following example illustrates its potential for simulating a classic experiment in biochemistry: *the characterization of amino acids, peptides, and proteins by chromogenic reactions in test tubes*. As the scope of this material is to present and facilitate the use of various *OIERs* (*interactive reproducible teaching objects*), users are recommended to search for sources of information related to the reactions briefly described below.\n \n\n\n#### Simulator instructions {.unnumbered}\n\n\n| The simulator allows two options: a) discover the nature of a sample or b) discover the color pattern of reactions for a chosen sample.\n\\\n\n**Option A: discover the nature of a sample:**\n\n| Here you can *\"play\"* to check whether you are dealing with a protein/peptide (chain) sample, an amino acid (AA) sample, a specific mixture of AAs, or AA(s) present in a chain. To do this:\n\n1. Click on the image below and select *\"add.\"* A set of seven colored bars will be generated, representing the colors obtained in test tubes for seven different reactions for protein characterization: ninhydrin, biuret, Pauly, xanthoprotein, Sakagushi, Millon, and sulfur (Cys).\n\n2. Discover the type of sample based on the color pattern of the tubes presented, providing a guess. The guess must be by type (in the *\"Guess (type)\"* menu - AA, chain, or mixture of AAs) and by profile (in the *\"Guess (profile)\"* menu - random, specific AA(s), or specific mixture);\n\n3. After selecting the 2 menus, click *\"Check\"*. If you are correct, a *\"Score\"* just below will calculate the number of correct answers/number of samples *‘played’*;\n\n4. If you are wrong, try again or look for an explanation of the color pattern in *\"Explain\"*;\n\n5) There are two other possibilities: *\"Hard mode,\"* which hides the names of the reactions while maintaining their sequence, and *\"Shuffle,\"* which changes the order of the tubes;\n\n6) For a new sample, just click on *\"New sample\"*;\n\n\n**Option B: discover the color pattern of a reaction for a selected sample:**\n\n1. Select a sample in *\"Generate,\"* and click *\"New sample.\"* A set of tubes will be generated with the expected reaction pattern for the sample.\n\n[![](Eq/Id-Prot-7.png)](Eq/jsp_Id-Prot-7.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n\n### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n```{r eval =FALSE}\n1. Try clicking on \"New sample\" to check the frequency of possibilities;\n2. Try the two \"game\" operation options (yes, it's a game... after all, it has a scoreboard!);\n3.

In this case, for simplicity, although *JSPlotly* works with more specific libraries, the nonlinear regression is performed by least squares, but carried out by *grid search*, and not by classical iterative methods.

The goal is to find the parameters $\\theta$ that minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals between the observed data *yi* and the values predicted by the model f(xi,$\\theta$. Unlike the full Newton-Raphson method, Gauss-Newton avoids the explicit calculation of the Hessian by using an approximation based on the Jacobian of the residuals.\n\n\n## Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n| This approximation results in a linear system that can be solved at each iteration to update the model parameters. The central formula of the method consists of multiplying the transposed Jacobian *JT* by the Jacobian *J* itself, forming a symmetric matrix that approximates the Hessian.
