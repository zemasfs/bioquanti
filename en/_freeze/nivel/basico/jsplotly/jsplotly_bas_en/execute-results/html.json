Try changing the constant \"k_cinetica\" at the top of the code (ex.: 0.008, 0.017, 0.05) and use Play/Reset to compare;\n2. Try turning inhibitor and catalyst on/off;\n3. Try changing the strength of the modulators above by editing their constants:\n  a. const fator_catalise  = 2.0; \n  b. const fator_inibicao  = 3.0; \n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Applications\n\n### Drawing board\n\n#### BNCC: EF15AR06, EF09AR07, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG606  {.unnumbered}\n\n|   Not only of mathematics, graphs and maps does *JSPlotly* \"live\". The example that follows intends to offer a board for drawings, with variation of colors and pen thickness, and geometric shapes.\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/desenho.png)](Eq/desenho.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Explore the script. Although simple, it allows selecting distinct colors, pen thicknesses, and geometric shapes;\n2. As the other objects elaborated in JSPlotly, the board drawing can be stored preserving its interactivity by the \"html\" button, and even modified in the saved file itself (\"play.html\");\n3. If you want to change colors, thicknesses, or want to add other functionalities, check the script variables;\n4. Try the \"clone\" button, which allows cloning the board along with its code. \n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### Gizz - Digital Blackboard\n\n|   The nature of the object below needs no introduction. It is one more among the many applications to simulate a chalkboard, or digital pen board. Different from its competitors, however:\n\n1. It can be exported as a self-contained HTML file with a button on the board itself, allowing sharing of the generated image, as well as continuity of its editing;\n2. It allows customization of the code that produces it, allowing inserting/changing pens, thicknesses, and distinct actions not foreseen in the source code.\n   \\\n\n[![](Eq/lousa.png)](Eq/lousa.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n|   With respect to its facilities, the digital board allows:\n\n* Write with 7 colors and 3 distinct thicknesses;\n* Access 4 backgrounds of different coloration;\n* Overlay the background with a *grid*;\n* Use an eraser (*erase*);\n* Use a *laser pointer* to locate what one intends to point out;\n* Save the image as PNG, indicating date and time;\n* Save the image as self-contained HTML (obs: *html* button on the board; the editor one does not work in this object);\n* Undo command (*undo*) and cleaning (*clean*) of the board;\n* Has keyboard shortcuts: E=eraser; L=laser; Z undo, X clean, H save HTML\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. One can change the thickness of the pens in \"var baseWidth = 1;\" ;\n2. The 1x, 2x, 4x buttons are multipliers; edit the button creation lines to change label/multiplier (ex.: \"addSize('3x', 3, true)\").\n\nObs: the functional button to reproduce the board is the one on the board itself, \"html\". The code editor button does not operate for the application.\n```\n:::\n\n\n### MentMapa - editor for mind map and diagrams\n\n|   In the same line of customizing *JSPlotly* as done above for the digital board, the program also allows building a diagram or mind map elaborated by *mouse clicks*, and as an independent application.\n\n|   The *Mind Map Editor* illustrated in the figure below allows building diverse structures, and fundamentally by combining terms and arrows. There are various functionalities for the facilitated creation of a map or diagram, including a help banner in the upper left corner for several of the actions.\n\\\n\n**Instructions for MentMap**\n\\\n\n* *Creating terms*. Click with the left mouse button and type a term; press Esc to exit;\n* *Deleting terms*. Click Ctrl+right mouse button;\n* *Frame on terms*. Click on a frame on the bar (square, diamond, oval);\n* *Connecting terms by arrow*. Right-click the 1st term, followed by right-click on the 2nd term;\n* *Curved arrow*. Click *curve on*. Then, right-click the 1st term, followed by left-click on a point between the two terms, and finish with right-click on the 2nd term. To adjust the arrow curvature, click the little ball and drag it to touch a term or an arrow;\n* *Drag terms and arrows*. Just click and drag.\n* *Drag a group of terms/arrows*. Press Shift and draw the area you want to encompass the group with the left mouse button;\n* *Colors for terms and arrows*. Select one of the 7 colors available on the top bar, and click an existing term, or a new one. Obs: the arrow color follows that of the terms;\n* *Grid* for more precise positioning. Just click *grid on* (it is not saved in the final diagram);\n* *Saving the map (save html)*. Different from the usual *html* button, storing the interactive map is done by its own *html button*, on the icon bar;\n* *Importing maps (import)*. The application allows importing an already ready map in *json* format to continue its editing;\n* *Exporting maps (export)*. The application also allows exporting the map in *json* format for future study or simple keeping.\n  \\\n\n[![](Eq/mapa_mental)](Eq/mapaMental.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. The editor allows creating mind maps, diagrams, flowcharts, and other representations...so now the suggestion is yours !!\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Card game\n\n|   Because *JSPlotly* involves a programming language, *JavaScript*, it is plausible that it can offer a set of operations tangible to it, independently of building graphs (as in diagrams and flowcharts above).\n\n|   In parallel to the richness that accompanies *gamification* as an active methodology, the *creation of a game* can stimulate the learner to another level, since strategy is sometimes already part of their daily life. Playing is one thing...creating a game can have a more prominent and recursive impact on computational thinking and logic, as well as on learning the programming language itself!\n\n### Memory Game\n\n#### BNCC: EF06MA19, EF06MA16, EF07MA26, EF09MA19, EM13MAT401, EM13MAT102, EM13MAT403, EM13LGG701 {.unnumbered}\n\n|   The clickable image below directs to a classic *Numeric Memory Game*. The objective is to hit a pair of values after memorizing a numeric grid. To play, follow the instructions below:\n\\\n\n**Instructions for the Numeric Memory Game:**\n\n* 1. In the upper field there are two boolean constants true/false, one to play (*jogue*) and another to check correctness (*verificar*), as well as a *seed* that fixes a certain random numeric grid;\n* 2. Start the game (*jogue/false*, *verificar/false*);\n* 3. Click the *add* button and a grid of numeric pairs for memorization will be displayed;\n* 4. Switch to *jogue/true*, click *clean plot*, and then *add*. The grid will now be displayed with only one value (other cells will show *\"?\"*);\n* 6. Choose *verificar/true*, click *clean plot*, and then *add*. A field will be presented to type the coordinates where you believe the other numeric pair is (Ex: A2);\n* 7. Click *OK*, and a pair formed by the initial value and the chosen value will be presented, to verify correctness.\n\n|   To restart the game, *clean plot*, and boolean options *false*.\n\n|   Have fun!!\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/game.png)](Eq/jsp_game2.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. To play again changing the grid values, just change the *seed* constant to any number;\n2. To vary between difficulty levels of the game, just change the number of rows and columns in the respective code constants. \n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Accessibility and inclusion\n\n|   Through keyboard touches, font size adjustment, vibration on capacitive screens, it is possible to imagine the use of *JavaScript* with *Plotly.js* to serve an audience with specific accessibility needs.\n\n|   Illustrating this possibility, and due to the use of audio resources by *JavaScript* libraries, it is possible to conceive *JSPlotly* objects intended for a student who is blind.\n\n### Equasons\n\n#### BNCC: EF69LP27, EF69AR09, EM13MAT406, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG701 {.unnumbered}\n\n|   This object is simple. It is enough for the student with the disability to use the left and right arrows of a simple keyboard so that they hear sounds correlated to a mathematical function chosen by a supervisor. Thus, if the function grows, the sound will have progressively higher timbres and, when it decreases, lower ones.\n\n|   In addition, it is possible to change the frequency on the slider bar, which allows sound perception for lower or higher frequencies.\n\n|   Once exported by the HTML button of the object itself (*and not the code editor*), it can be shared while maintaining the interactivity and sonority of the function.\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/acessib.png)](Eq/acessib.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. One can edit the code for a specific function. For this, just change the line \"var f = function(x){ ... }\". Examples:\n  a. return Math.sin(x*Math.PI/180); (degrees);\n  b. return Math.sin(x); (radians);\n  c. return Math.exp(-0.01*x)*Math.cos(0.2*x);\n2. One can change the scrolling speed of the function by the function below, and whose value is given in milliseconds:\n  \"var PLAY_INTERVAL_MS = 100; \"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Music education\n\n|   The objects below introduce another potential for *JSPlotly*, namely, the possibility of working with audio. Among the possible libraries, the examples below illustrate the use of *tone.js*, both for a monophonic instrument (*recorder*), and for a polyphonic instrument (*piano*).\n\n|   In parallel to the possibility of editing the code to improve and customize the object, both can be easily used as digital musical instruments *standalone*, since they can be exported by the \"html\" button preserving their interactivity by mouse or touch on capacitive screens of mobile devices.\n\n### FlautaDoce\n\n#### BNCC: EF15AR05, EF69AR09, EM13LGG601, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG701 {.unnumbered}\n\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/flauta.png)](Eq/flauta.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. The recorder was conceived for tones (circle) and semitones (semicircles). You can \"play\" the recorder by clicking with the left mouse button on a hole or using your finger on a smartphone;\n2. You can add or omit some hole in the recorder, just by changing the two lines of the variables \"var naturais\" and \"var sustenidos\";\n2. You can turn your recorder into a \"pífano\", generally higher than the recorder, and quite common in northeastern tradition. For this, just replace the lines of the variables \"var naturais\" and \"var sustenidos\", changing the value of \"5\" to \"6\", as follows (add \"add\" afterwards - or \"clean\"/\"add\"):\n    var naturais   = [\"C6\",\"D6\",\"E6\",\"F6\",\"G6\",\"A6\",\"B6\"];\n    var sustenidos = [\"C#6\",\"D#6\",\"F6\",\"F#6\",\"G#6\",\"A#6\",\"B6\"];\n3. In the reasoning line above, it is also possible to change the recorder pattern, low recorders and contrabass. For example, a German recorder (larger hole, soprano, used in Schools and represented in the script) or Baroque (smaller hole, lower tones).\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### Piano\n\n#### BNCC: F15AR05, EF69AR09, EM13LGG601, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG701 {.unnumbered}\n\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/piano.png)](Eq/piano.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. It is a small piano, but it is a piano (2 octaves)!! And as such, you can express your musical aptitude with the polyphonic instrument;\n2. To prolong the sound of the keys raise the \"sustain\" bar;\n3. As part of JSPlotly, the piano can be shared without the code, only as an instrument for music education or practice, since it is exported by the \"html\" button, preserving its interactivity and sonority by mouse or finger touch on a mobile device;\n4. Also as part of JSPlotly, it is possible to share the piano with the codes for changes via the \"clone\" button;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Games\n\n|   Although almost a translation, *jogos* refer to a broad variety, including cards and board games, while *games* more reflect electronic and digital games. Below are two *games* illustrative of the potential of *JSPlotly* for this purpose, *Bow and arrow*, which uses only animation, and *Pong*, a classic sports video game from 1972. Different from the first, *Pong* combines interactivity, animation, and sound.\n\n### Bow and Arrow Game\n\n#### BNCC: EF09CI09, EF09MA18, EM13MAT302, EM13CNT104, EM13LGG701 {.unnumbered}\n\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/arcoFlecha.png)](Eq/arcoFlecha.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Change the angle (\"let theta_edit = 45\") and/or the initial shot velocity (\"let v0_edit    = 20\") to adjust the parabola to the target;\n2. Notice that the score is flexible: 5 points for proximity to the target, and 10 points when it hits it.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### Pong Game\n\n#### BNCC: EF69AR09, EF06MA20, EM13LGG604, EM13LGG701 {.unnumbered}\n\n|   For the reproduction of this classic game the additional library *p5.js* was used, aimed at interactive art, animations and data visualizations on the web.\n\n[![](Eq/pong.png)](Eq/pong.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. If you think the game is slow, even at the maximum 'warp' speed, it is possible to change its value in \"var base = Math.pow(1.5, warp);\";\n2. If you think the game is too hard or too easy, it is possible to change the paddle size in \"paddle = { w: 80, h: 10,...\";\n3. If you want to increase the game area, modify the line below (width, height):\n  \"var cv = sk.createCanvas(400, 300).parent('jogoArea');\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Experimental Interface\n\n### Mobile - Sensor data acquisition\n\n|   *JSPlotly* was initially conceived for the construction of interactive *virtual learning objects*. However, it is possible to integrate it with different interfaces for acquiring real-world data. The following example illustrates as a target the response for an *accelerometer*, a positioning sensor of a mobile device (accelerometer).\n\n[![](Eq/celular.png)](Eq/celular_JSPlotly.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.

An Arduino Uno R3 board was used with *Web Serial* connection by USB to a notebook running an autonomous application for *JSPlotly*. Conductivity was obtained by a commercial TDS sensor (*total dissolved solids*) with excitation by square-wave alternating potential (PWM) to minimize polarization effects, and *script* adapted from the manufacturer. The TDS sensor operates in the range of 3.3 to 5.0 V (input) with output of 0 to 2.3 V, and current of 3 to 6 mA.\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/arduino.png)](Eq/condutiv_JSPlotly.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n*Example of JSPlotly application to interface with Arduino.

For *Web Serial* connection it is necessary to install *Python* on the computer (Windows or Linux), and *setup* of a local server. For Windows download and install the official file for [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), remembering to click *Add Python to PATH*, and type the commands in CMD inside the standalone application folder. Below is the guidance for Linux:\n\n* 1) Connect the Arduino and components (TDS probe, container with water and salt);\n* 2. Copy, paste and run the distributor's *script* for TDS on the connected Arduino IDE ([example 1](https://www.usinainfo.com.br/blog/projeto-sensor-condutividade-solo-thc-s-com-arduino/?srsltid=AfmBOorI1tfAWdSpnYiK34zbl7j35A4mNUXBKcDbV6OoAf4A-rkTrlu3), [example 2](https://wiki.dfrobot.com/gravity__analog_tds_sensor___meter_for_arduino_sku__sen0244?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=834127384&gclid=Cj0KCQiA-YvMBhDtARIsAHZuUzIgeSprXZrRIVB7ss58n1pBZcm5kST1Zu1kPP_q3rQK9v-ExIRUljwaAmgwEALw_wcB) );\n* 3.
