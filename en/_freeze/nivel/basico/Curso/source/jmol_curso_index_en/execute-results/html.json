Access the online version of Jmol\\\n2. Load a molecule into Jmol\\\n\n</div>\n\\\n\n## Where to start?\n\n| You can start using *Jmol* in several ways. If you are using it on your computer or laptop, or even from a removable media (*flash drive*), you can access it by downloading, unzipping, and running the `Jmol.jar` file located in the main folder on the [Jmol website](https://jmol.sourceforge.net/).\n\n| Now, if you don't want to install anything, you can also access it *online* from various sites. In this *Course*, we will use a very famous one, adapted from one of the program's developers. Just click on this [*link*](https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=water) in a new tab.\n\n\n| Alternatively, **throughout this Course, you can copy the code from any example by clicking on the *\"folder\"* icon to the right of each shaded area. Done! The code is copied to the clipboard. Now just paste it somewhere (notepad or Jmol)**. In the case of *Jmol*, copy the *link* below and paste it into a new tab in your browser, then press *Enter*.\n\n<br /> <!-- new line; also to use only \" \\ \" -->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhttps://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=water\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n| Now, click on the molecule with the left button of your mouse or with the touchpad (for notebooks), and make random movements. Or rotate the middle mouse button, or perform pinch and zoom gestures with two fingers on the touchpad. The @fig-screenHome below illustrates the result.\n\n<br />\n\n[![Screen (clickable) showing the water molecule model rendered in a browser by the St. Olaff College website.](screenHome.png){#fig-screenHome}](https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=water)\n\n| This is the main essence when we refer to the idea of **flying molecules** for this *Course*.\n\n\n<!-- NOTE: The applet works with Jmol commands even when you are OFFLINE !! -->\n\n## How to load a molecule *online* ?\n\n| To *play* around with another molecule, try changing the model on the internet page itself, at the end of the line. And now follow the *MAP (Teaching support material)*.\n\n\n![Some representations of molecules. Source: MAP: high school - 1st semester, 3rd year, p.51. Natural sciences and their technologies.](vitC_mapa.png)\n\\\n\n| Let's illustrate this with the structure of *vitamin C (ascorbic acid)*.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhttps://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=ascorbic acid\n```\n:::\n\n\n| You can try this with other molecules by typing their names *in English*, as this is a foreign *website*. However, the database for this search is not unlimited, and sometimes the system will not find the desired molecule.\n\n| But there are alternatives. One of them is to search for the name of the molecule on a website used as a database, [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). For example, for *vitamin C (ascorbic acid)*:\n\\\n\n\n\n<div class=\"reminder-markdown\">\n\n**Now it's up to you**:\n\n1. Go to the [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) website;\n2. Search for `tylenol`;\n3. If it exists, type that same term at the end of the *JSmol online* line, as follows, and see if it works:\n\\\nhttps://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=tylenol\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n## How to upload a molecule *online*, but in 2D\n\n| Sometimes it can be interesting to view a molecular model statically and in two dimensions. To do this, simply add *\"image2d\"* to the line of code, as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhttps://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jmol.php?model=tylenol&image2d\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 2 - Mouse clicks *versus* command text\n\n<div class=\"reminder-objectives\">\n\nObjectives:\\\n1. Observe that there are two ways to perform actions in some programs: using the mouse or using text commands\\\n2. Observe the characteristics of each method\\\n3. Learn some principles for \"Reproducible Teaching\" and the advantages of using command lines instead of mouse movements\\\n</div>\n\n\n\n",
