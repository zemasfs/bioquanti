To illustrate this, it may be interesting to load a *water model* (`load $water`), whose distances and angles are found in some chemistry textbooks.\n\n\n### For distances\n\n| In the example of the water molecule, to determine the distance of an O-H bond, for example, execute:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Double-click on the first atom;\n2. Drag the mouse to the second atom;\n3. Click on the second atom\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n| Trying this for the distance of the O-H bond, the program returns the value 0.097 nm, or 0.97 Angstroms, the conventional value for this type of covalent bond.\n\n![Measuring distance within the molecule.](aguaDist.png)\n\n\n### For angles\n\n| For the same water molecule, try to determine the bond angle:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Double-click on the first atom (e.g., H);\n2. Drag to the second atom (e.g., O);\n3. Click on the second atom;\n4. Drag to the third atom (e.g., the other H);\n5. Click on the third atom\n```\n:::\n\n\n| Note that the system returns a value of 114°, which is close to the expected value for the molecule (109.5°) or the measured value (104.5°). This approximation is due to the construction of the water model.\n\n![Measuring angle within the molecule.](aguaAng.png)\n\n| To clear the measurements, use the command:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmeasure off\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Molecular characteristics\n\n| There is a lot of tangible information about a molecular model in *Jmol*. Here are some examples of the most basic information for the molecule of a component of *shoyo* sauce, glutamate:\n\n\n### Charges\n\n| Sometimes it can be interesting to show the polarity of molecules based on their charge distribution. In *Jmol* there are two types of charges, *effective charge (`formaCharge`) and partial charge (`partialcharge`)*. We can illustrate the charge distribution in a surfactant molecule, such as hexadecanoate.\n\n![Example of a 16-carbon surfactant, hexadecenoic acid. Source: MAPA: high school - 3rd semester, 3rd year, p.63. Natural sciences and their technologies.](hexadecanoate_mapa.png)\n\n\n| To do this, type the following commands in the *Console*:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload $hexadecanoate\ncalculate partialCharge # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %P # presentation of charges (labeling)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n| A feature of *Jmol* that makes it more efficient to execute actions is the sequential arrangement of commands. This way, it is not necessary to click *Enter* for each command, just separate the commands with semicolons (*;*) as illustrated below, to calculate the partial charges of the glutamate molecule:\n\n![Presentation of partial charges in the glutamate model, a component of Shoyo sauce, also illustrating a sequence of actions in Jmol.](glu.png)\n\n\n| Similarly, the obtaining of *formal charges* in the model can be illustrated. In this case, transparent coloring was added for better visualization of the negative unit charge of the carboxylic acid:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncalculate formalcharges # calculation of partial charges of the model\nlabel %C # presentation of charges (labeling)\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Illustration of the commands in sequence for viewing formal charges in the glutamate molecule.](gluFormal.png)\n\n| Note that the commands in the figure mix upper and lower case letters, unlike the command line that precedes them. This is a **cool feature of *Jmol*, which does not care about font capitalization**. In other words, it does not matter if you use lower case, upper case, or a combination of both; *Jmol* performs the action in the same way.\n\n\n#### Scripts & Reproducible Teaching\n\n| The example above shows a simple way to concatenate commands, facilitating the automatic and sequential execution of a set of them. However, the command line view is somewhat impaired by the separation with *\";\"*, which can cause visual pollution when there are several commands.\n\n| The workaround involves arranging the commands in a *script* format. This is nothing more than a piece of code containing one command per line, which improves the visualization of the code as a whole. In addition, the *script* has the added advantage of allowing comments to be inserted between command lines, also allowing for better appropriation of the code and its learning.\n\nThese characteristics of a *command line with explanatory comments* give *Jmol* its aspect for *programming* sequential actions, and consequently establish one of the basic premises for *Reproducible Teaching*: the writing of code snippets in single-line commands, written as in a notepad, with comments on the program's actions on each line. \n\n\nAs an example for a *script* involving the actions for glutamate above, just copy the snippet below and paste it into the *JSmol* *Console*, then execute it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload $glu # loading micromolecule \nwireframe only # exclusive rendering of rods\ncalculate partialCharge # partial charge\nlabel %P \n```\n:::\n\n\n| Another aspect inherent to the *Reproducible Teaching* initiative is the *possibility of evaluating the code with some changes*, aiming at a slightly modified final product. Try repeating the above snippet, but for effective charges, that is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload $glu # loading micromolecule \ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\ncalculate formalCharge # effective charge \nlabel %C \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n| In addition, you can change more commands in the code to create a result that is completely different from the original. This defines another feature of *Reproducible Teaching*, namely *code snippet creation*. To illustrate, here is an excerpt based on the previous one, but for energy minimization and restructuring of the molecule's orbitals.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload $glu # micromolecule loading \ncpk only # exclusive rendering by filled space\nminimize # command for structure energy minimization \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Molecular characteristics\n\n\n| Sometimes it is also interesting to introduce the class to the concept of *weak forces* that permeate molecular interactions, as illustrated below.\n\n\n![[Some weak forces in molecular interaction. Source: MAPA: high school - 2nd semester, 1st year, p.75. Natural sciences and their technologies.](interacao_mapa.png)\n\n\n| In addition to structural prediction for *partial charge and formal charge*, *Jmol* also allows you to highlight *weak forces* in the model, such as *van der Waals clouds* and *hydrogen bonds*, as follows.\n\n\n### Van der Waals cloud\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndots on # van der Waals cloud on the atoms of the model (remove with \"dots off\")\ncalculate hbonds # identifies hydrogen bonds in the model\n```\n:::\n\n\n| To illustrate, copy and paste the following snippet into the *Console*:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload $water\ndots on # van der Waals cloud on the water structure\ndots ionic # ionic cloud over the model\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Example of the overlap of van der Waals clouds on the atoms of the water molecule.](vanderwaals.png)\n\n![Illustrating the representation of the ionic cloud for the water model.](ionic.png) \n\\\n\n### Hydrogen bonds\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload=1djf # loads a peptide model\ncalculate hbonds # displays the H bonds present in the structure\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n![Example of hydrogen bonds in a peptide model.](ligacoesH.png)\n\n## Surfaces\n\n| In addition to the van der Waals surface (*dots on*) seen above, *Jmol* is capable of representing some surfaces for molecular models. The larger the molecule, the greater the internal calculation to generate the surface, which can make it difficult to visualize. Thus, illustrating a simple command for the surface of a water molecule:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nisosurface molecular # molecular surface that includes the solvent\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Molecular surface for the water model.](isosurfMolec.png)\n",
