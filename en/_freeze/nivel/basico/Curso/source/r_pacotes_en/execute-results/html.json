Understand what R packages are and what they are used for\\\n2. Know how to install and load an R package, using `plotly` as an example\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n## Why install packages?\n\n| In a simple answer, because each of the more than 21,000 `R` packages has an extension of resources that `R` itself does not have in its original installation. In other words, it extends the tool for a specific purpose, such as *reproducing and even modifying code snippets that result in interactive teaching objects for basic education*. \n\n| For this, we will use only two packages, `plotly` and `leaflet`. This means that the interactivity packages need to be installed before the code can be executed. But don't worry. This is one of the easiest parts of working with `R`.\n\n\n## Installing the `plotly` package in `R` \n\n\n1. Go to the *Packages* tab in *RStudio*.\n\n![](pacotes.rstudio.png)\n\n\n2. Type the name of the package in the field (`plotly`), and click *Install*.\n\n![](pacotes.plotly.png)\n\n| Done! The package will be installed from the *RStudio* cloud server (whether on your computer or in the cloud), with some intermediate messages in red, as shown below.\n\n![](pacotes.msg.png)\n\n## Loading the installed package\n\n| `R` allows you to install a huge number of packages. But of course you won't use them all at the same time. So `R` needs to *\"know\"* which package you want at any given moment, which is done by the `library` command, illustrated below for the `plot_ly` package, as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(plotly)\n```\n:::\n\n\n| Done! Package installed and loaded!\n| Now it's time to execute some code snippets for educational purposes.\n\n",
