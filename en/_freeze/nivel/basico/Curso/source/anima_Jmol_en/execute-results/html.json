Understand a molecule animation as a script\\\n2. Use the molecule animation console\\\n\n</div>\n\n\n## Animate the molecules.\n\n\n| And we have reached the last part of the *Course* with *Jmol*, to present a very interesting educational effect of the program: *molecule animation*.\n\n| You may want to show a molecule with different styles during a certain period, or make a slow transition between colors in specific atoms, or even controlled enlargement, reduction, or rotation effects. And many others that your imagination and technical rigor allow you to study.\n\n| In these cases, it is interesting to know and apply a few animation commands explained below. The examples have been selected to simplify each command. But don't be fooled by the capabilities of *Jmol*, because for each command there are always several complementary options. And if you want to know anything about any *Jmol* command, visit the [reference website](https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/docs/).\n\n\n### Spin\n\n| Simple command to rotate the molecule.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nload $glucose; spin 30 # the value refers to the rotation speed\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### ZoomTo (resize)\n\n| This command is impressive because it allows for controlled magnification or reduction over time. Its syntax is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n*zoomTo* : time (optional expression) size\n```\n:::\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nIncrease by 3x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 *3 \n\nIncrease by 4x, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5 400\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand with 2x magnification: zoomto 2(ligand) 0\n\nFocus on a biopolymer ligand with 4x magnification, half a second at a time: zoomto 0.5(ligand)* 4\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Delay\n\n| This is a **key command** for any animation, as it allows the image of the molecule in *Jmol* to pause (in seconds) before the next action. It is normally used in the sequence of commands by the *Console* throughout a *script*.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndelay 3 # waits 3 seconds before the next action\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n| We can try out an animation with the above commands using the cyclohexanol model.\n\n\n![Cyclohexanol structure.

Just copy and paste it into the *Console* and run it. If you prefer to make any changes, it is best to copy it to a notepad, modify it, and test the *script* in the *Console*.\n\n\n<div class=\"reminder-markdown\">\n\n**Now it's up to you:**\n\nload $cyclohexanol\n\\\ndelay 2\n\\\nspin Y 70\n\\\ndelay 2\n\\\nspin off\n\\\nzoomTo 2 \\*2\n\\\ncpk\n\\\ndelay 2\n\\\ncolor transparent\n\\\nzoomTo 2 \\*0.5\n\\\nspin 50\n\n\n\n</div>\n",
