For better use of each theme, try to follow the code Suggestions for each object. \n\\\n\n\n\n**General instructions**\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Choose a theme;\n2. Click on the corresponding plot;\n3. Click on \"add\";\n4. Use the mouse for interactivity and/or edit the code. \n\nReminder: the editor uses infinite undo/redo in the code (Ctrl+Z / Shift+Ctrl+Z) !\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Simulations\n\n### Acid–base equilibrium and buffer system\n\n#### Context: {.unnumbered}\n\n|   The example illustrates the addition of base in a system containing a weak acid and its conjugate base. The titration equation refers to a *triprotic acid*, phosphoric acid of the homonymous buffer, but it would equally serve for many others, such as those present in the Krebs cycle (citrate, isocitrate).\n\n#### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\nfa= \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa1 - pH}} + \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa2 - pH}} + \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pKa3 - pH}}\n$$\n*Where*,\nfa = acid fraction (protonable groups)\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/tit_acbase.png)](Eq/jsp_acbase.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n<!---div class=\"jsplotly_sup-fundo\"> --->\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"A. Converting the phosphate buffer curve (triprotic) to bicarbonate buffer (diprotic)\"\n\n1. Change the pKa values to those of the bicarbonate buffer: pKa1 =      6.1, and pKa2 = 10.3;\n2. Set a very large value for pKa3 (e.g., 1e20). \n3. Click on \"add plot\".\n\nExplanation: pKa is a term that represents the logarithm of a dissociation constant (-log[Ka]). With an extreme value, the denominator also becomes immense, nullifying the term that carries pKa3. In JavaScript and other languages, \"e\" represents the notation for power of 10.\n\n\"B.

Just repeat the procedure above, with pKa1 = 4.75, and eliminating pKa2.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### Ionization state of chemical groups of biomolecules\n\n#### Context: {.unnumbered}\n\n|   *JSPlotly* also allows the observation of some concepts facilitated by *animation-based learning* together with graphical representations obtained by mathematical functions. In the example that follows, the interactive object illustrates the protonation state for the main chemical groups found in biomolecules.\n\\\n\n**Instruction**\n\n1. After clicking the corresponding image below, click on \"add\" and observe the generated acid–base titration plot. The abscissa axis (x-axis) has an extensive range of pH values, and the ordinate axis the charge that the molecule with ionization potential manifests at each pH, and as a function of its pKa value;\n\n2. Click on \"Animate\" to observe the displacement of a small ball along the titration curve, up to a pH value pre-defined in the simulator script, and as a function of its pKa;\n\n3. Modify in the *script* the type of ionizable group (in *\"let grupo_edit = \"*) and/or the desired final pH (*\"let pH_final_edit = \"*), to evaluate the ionization state of a new group;\n\n4.

Simulate the ionization state of different molecules, such as drugs with carboxylic acid (e.g., acetylsalicylic acid... aspirin), at blood pH and in the gastric cavity;\n3. Create a new ionizable group and predict its ionization state. For this, just change the information in 3 constants at the beginning of the script: groups, pKas, and types.\n  a. \n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### Net charge network in peptides\n\n#### Context: {.unnumbered}\n\n|   The code refers to the net charge network present in any sequence of amino acid residues.

To illustrate this approach, an animation follows for observing the charge of an amino acid based on the value of its *pKa*, and on the information of its *pI*, the isoelectric point of the compound (pH value at which the species has zero net charge).\n\n|   To visualize the charge value *q* (*\"current state\"*), click the \"add\" button followed by \"Animate\". For another animation, just select the amino acid (*\"let aa_edit =\"*) and the final pH at which you wish to observe its charge (*\"let pH_final_edit = \"*). The animation also allows comparing the charge of a free amino acid with that of the corresponding residue in a polypeptide chain (option *\"let contexto_edit  = \"*). Note that the animation provides a legend informing the pKa value of the compound for its ionizable groups.\n\n[![](Eq/AA_pHpKapI.png)](Eq/jsp_AA_pHpKapI.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.

The example uses the primary sequence of lysozyme, a hydrolase that acts in breaking the microbial wall.\n\n#### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\nq_{\\text{net}}(pH) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left[ n_i \\cdot q_{B_i} + \\frac{n_i}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a_i}}} \\right]\n$$\n\n*Where*,\n\n* qnet = total net charge;\n* qB$_{i} = charge of the basic form for residue i (for example, +1 for Lys, 0 for Asp);\n* n$_{i}$ = number of groups of residue *i*.\n\n[![](Eq/pI.png)](Eq/jsp_pI.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"Finding the pI for other proteins\"\n\n1. One can verify the titration of any other protein or peptide sequence by simply substituting the primary sequence contained in the code. An assertive way to perform this substitution involves:\n  a. Search for the \"FASTA\" sequence of the protein in NCBI (\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/\") - e.g.: \"papain\";\n  b. Click on \"FASTA\" and copy the sequence obtained in 1a.;\n  c. Paste the sequence into a site for residue quantification (e.g., \"https://www.protpi.ch/Calculator/ProteinTool\");\n4. Substitute the sequence in the code. \n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### Hydrophobicity in amino acid sequences\n\n#### Context: {.unnumbered}\n\n|   Observing hydrophobicity levels of amino acids can be useful for the study and prediction of residue sequences, such as those found in the central portion of helices of transmembrane proteins, as for identification of specific sites in enzymes, such as clefts and hydrophobic pockets.\n\n|   These levels are classified in a relative way, giving rise to some indices such as the *Kyte–Doolittle scale*, which assigns each amino acid a hydropathy value (hydrophobicity/hydrophobicity) estimated from experimental and observational data. Positive values indicate hydrophobic tendency (e.g., Ile, Val, Leu) and negative values indicate hydrophilic tendency (e.g., Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg). The index allows highlighting stretches prone to nonpolar environments, as well as regions exposed to the aqueous solvent.\n\n#### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\n\\tilde{y}*i ;=; \\frac{1}{w} \\sum*{k=i-m}^{i+m} y_k,\n\\qquad w = 2m+1\n$$\n\\\n\n*Where*,\n\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_i &:; \\text{hydrophobicity value at position $i$ of the sequence} \\\n\\tilde{y}_i &:; \\text{smoothed value (moving average) at position $i$} \\\nm &:; \\text{half-window (number of neighbors on each side)} \\\nw &:; \\text{total window width ($w=2m+1$)} \\\ni &:; \\text{amino acid position in the sequence ($1 \\leq i \\leq N$)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\n[![](Eq/hidrofob.png)](Eq/jsp_hidrofob.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.

The following model exemplifies this interaction, by use of the *Hill equation*.\n\n#### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\nY= \\frac{pO_2^{nH}}{p_{50}^{nH} + pO_2^{nH}}\n$$\n\\\n\n*Where*\n\n* Y = degree of oxygen saturation in the protein;\n* pO$_{2}$ = oxygen pressure;\n* p$_{50}$ = oxygen pressure at 50% saturation;\n* nH = Hill coefficient for the interaction;\n  \\\n\n[![](Eq/O2.png)](Eq/jsp_O2.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\\\n\n<!---div class=\"jsplotly_sup-fundo\"> --->\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Run the application (\"add plot\"). See that the value of \"nH\" of the Hill constant is \"1\", that is, without cooperativity effect.\n\n2. Now replace the value of \"nH\" with the Hill coefficient for hemoglobin, 2.8, and run again !\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### Bohr effect in hemoglobin (pH)\n\n#### Context: {.unnumbered}\n\n|   Some physiological or pathological conditions can alter the binding affinity of oxygen with hemoglobin, such as temperature, some metabolites (2,3-BPG), and the hydrogen ion content of the solution.\n\n#### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\nY(pO_2) = \\frac{{pO_2^n}}{{P_{50}^n + pO_2^n}}, \\quad \\text{with } P_{50} = P_{50,\\text{ref}} + \\alpha (pH_{\\text{ref}} - pH)\n$$\n\n*Where*,\n\n* Y = hemoglobin saturation,\n* pO$_{2}$ = partial pressure of oxygen (in mmHg),\n* P$*{50}$ = pressure of O$*{2}$ at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated,\n* P$_{50,ref}$ = 26 mmHg (standard value),\n* $\\alpha$ = 50 (intensity of the Bohr effect),\n* pH$_{ref}$ = 7.4,\n* n = 2.8 = Hill coefficient for hemoglobin.\n\n[![](Eq/jspl_bohr.png)](Eq/jspl_bohr.html)\n\n#### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.

Enzymatic catalysis in the absence of inhibitor.\"\n1. Just run the application with the general equation. See that the values for Kic and Kiu are high (1e20). In this way, with high \"dissociation constants\", the interaction of the inhibitor with the enzyme is irrelevant, returning the model to the classic Michaelis–Menten equation.\n2. Try changing the values of Vm and Km, comparing plots.\n3. Use the geographic coordinates feature of the icon bar (\"Toggle Spike Lines\"), to consolidate the mathematical meaning of Km, as well as observe the effect of distinct values of this on the visualization of the plot.\n\n\"B.

Among these, the hyperbolic nature of the michaelian model is alternatively treated by several transformations of the variables *S* and *v*, standing out in the literature the linearization by *double-reciprocal*, or *Lineweaver–Burk* transformation.\n\n|   The example that follows illustrates the relationship between the dependent and independent variables of the original and transformed model, using another feature of the *Plotly.js* library: the possibility of cross-selection of points.\n\n|   To observe this functionality, select a set of points in one of the *subplots* of the plot that follows, and observe their automatic selection in the other subplot.\n\n#### Equation {.unnumered}\n\n|   The linear transformation of Lineweaver–Burk is given below:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{S}*\\frac{Km}{Vm} + \\frac{1}{Vm}\n$$\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/LB.png)](Eq/jsp_LB.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n#### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Try selecting the extremes of the Michaelis–Menten plot (hyperbolic curve), and observe the same points in the double-reciprocal. Which values are more reliable in the latter, the first or the last?\n\n2. Research other forms of linearization (e.g., Eadie–Hofstee; \"v/S\" X \"v\"), and see how the transformation and point selection presents itself. For this, change the constants below:\n    const invS = S.map(s => 1/s);\n    const invV = V.map(v => 1/v);\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### Diagnosis of Enzymatic Inhibition (Michaelis–Menten and Lineweaver–Burk)\n\n#### Context {.unnumbered}\n\n|   As presented above and present in texts of the area, it is possible to linearize the Michaelis–Menten curve for a simpler observation for diagnosing enzymatic inhibition models. The object below proposes this interpretation. For this, keep the *control enzyme* without addition of inhibitor in the code (*I=0*). To seek an inhibition model, insert a value for *I* and change the inhibitor dissociation equilibrium constant(s), *kic* and/or *kiu*.\n\n[![](Eq/inib_diag.png)](Eq/jsp_inib_diag.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n#### Suggestion {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Simulate the conditions for a competitive inhibition, inserting a value for the inhibitor content (\"I\") and changing the value of \"Km\";\n2. Do the same for an uncompetitive model, although changing the value of \"Vm\";\n3. Try the pure noncompetitive model, changing \"Km\" and \"Vm\" to the same value;\n4. Test mixed competitive inhibition, inserting distinct values for \"Km\" and for \"Vm.\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n### van der Waals equation for ideal gases\n\n#### Context: {.unnumbered}\n\n|   An adaptation that relates the thermodynamic quantities of pressure, volume and temperature for ideal gases, is the *van der Waals equation*. In this, coefficients are computed that estimate the existence of a volume and inter-particle interactions. Thus, the van der Waals equation corrects the ideal gas equation considering a term to compensate intermolecular forces (a/V$^{2}$) and the available volume, this discounting the volume occupied by the gas molecules themselves.\n\n|   In the simulation an additional interactivity is offered by the presence of *sliders* (sliding controls) for temperature, and for the coefficients of finite volume (*b*) and interaction between particles (*a*).\n\n#### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n$$\nP = \\frac{RT}{V - b} - \\frac{a}{V^2}\n$$\n\n* P = gas pressure (atm);\n* V = molar volume (L);\n* T = temperature (K);\n* R = 0.0821 = ideal gas constant (L·atm/mol·K);\n* a = intermolecular attraction constant (L$^{2}$·atm/mol$^{2})\n* b = excluded volume constant (L/mol)\n\n[![](Eq/vanderWaals.png)](Eq/jsp_vanderWaals.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n#### Suggestion: {.unnumbered}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1.

EIS allows obtaining information about interfacial processes, such as charge transfer, ion diffusion and formation of passive films, through analysis of the complex impedance of the system. It is a non-destructive technique, widely used in areas such as corrosion, batteries, fuel cells, biosensors and protective coatings.\n\n#### Equation: {.unnumbered}\n\n|       An electrochemical impedance (EIS) model with typical equivalent-circuit components is the modified Randles: series resistor *Rs*, a resistor *Rp* in parallel with a *CPE* (Constant Phase Element), and a *Warburg* element. A common representation for EIS is the *Nyquist* plot, in which the real axis represents resistance (Zre) and the imaginary axis the negative reactance (−Zim). The formalism involved is in the equation below:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\text{total}}(\\omega) = R_s + \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1}{R_p} + Q (j\\omega)^n \\right)^{-1} \\right] + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\omega}} (1 - j)\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n* Z$_{total}$ = total impedance at a given frequency ;\n* $\\omega$ = angular frequency (rad/s), $\\omega$=2πf or $\\omega$=2πf;\n* R$_{p}$ = ohmic resistance (resistance of the electrolyte solution, wires, contacts etc.) ;\n* R$_{p}$ = polarization resistance (associated with charge-transfer processes, such as electrochemical reactions);\n* *Q* = constant associated with the constant phase element (CPE), replaces an ideal capacitor to represent non-ideal behaviors ;\n* *n* = CPE exponent, between 0 and 1; defines the degree of ideality of the capacitive behavior (n = 1: ideal capacitor; n < 1: dispersion);\n* $\\sigma$ = Warburg coefficient, associated with ion diffusion in the electrochemical system ;\n* *j* = imaginary unit, j$^{2}$ = −1;\n\n|       An electrochemical impedance (EIS) model with typical equivalent-circuit components is the modified Randles: series resistor *Rs*, a resistor *Rp* in parallel with a *CPE* (Constant Phase Element), and a *Warburg* element.

Try combining other values of the parameters in the code header, to highlight common situations in electroanalysis: Rs, Rp, Q, n, and sigma;\n3. Reduce the Warburg-with-constant-phase-element model to a simple Randles model, formed only by 2 resistors in series, the second in parallel with an ideal capacitor, and without Warburg diffusion (sigma = 0; n = 1).\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Cyclic voltammetry\n\n#### Context: {.unnumbered}\n\n|   Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is an electroanalytical technique for characterization of interfacial redox processes (electrode-solution). When a standard analyte in quantitative equilibrium between oxidized and reduced forms is used, the resulting plot acquires an unusual profile, named *duck shape*. This results from the peculiar format under a bidirectional potentiometric sweep over a set of electrodes by a *potentiostat*, resulting in oxidation cycles and subsequent reduction (application of positive potentials followed by negative ones).

Try the \"parameters\" mode with an \"nH\" value different from 1 (e.g., 2.8) to evaluate dose–response curve behavior under cooperativity effects;\n\n4. Try the \"parameters\" mode with a non-zero heat capacity value (e.g., -2000) to evaluate the possibility of secondary binding effects as a function of temperature, such as enzyme conformational transition;\n\n5. Test curvature of the van’t Hoff plot for a heat-capacity change by providing positive (e.g., 2000) and negative values (e.g., -2000): if concave up, negative heat-capacity change; if concave down, positive heat-capacity change.\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### References: {.unnumbered}\n\n1.

Note: T_m occurs when ΔG=0. In that case, a dashed vertical line is shown in the ΔG x T plot;\n2. Choose a didactic \"Preset\" and compare its effect on stability curves:\n  - None: coherent random draw.\n  - term ↑ΔG global: makes ΔS more negative (raises ΔG globally).\n  - term ↓ΔC_p: flattens curvature in ΔG(T).\n  - psychro ↑ΔC_p: accentuates curvature.\n  - binder ΔC_p<0: uses negative ΔC_p (cases of reduced hydrophobic binding etc.).\n3. Curvature of ΔG(T) grows with |ΔC_p|; thus, compare A vs B, and see the difference in the graphical profile (\"shape\") and T_m shift;\n4.

Data are plotted as a function of an experimental signal (absorbance/fluorescence), followed by the calculation of conformational fractions and effective Gibbs energy as a function of denaturant. The simulator also allows comparison between proteins or experimental conditions (A/B).\n\n|   The app uses a *two-state model* between a “native” set (F) and a “denatured” set (U). The denaturant effect is linear on the standard free energy of the monomer (LEA – Linear Extrapolation Assumption). To simulate an osmolyte effect (stabilizing or not), an empirical multiplicative term is applied to the slope (m).\n\\\n\n[![](Eq/toolkit/mtherm-toolkit.png)](Eq/toolkit/mtherm-toolkit.js){download=\"mtherm-toolkit.js\"}\n\n\\\n\n|   In addition, the simulator allows export of interactive figures and diagnostics (HTML), CSV export of denaturant, signal, and energy data together with diagnostics, as well as JSON interface presets for scenarios (save/load).\n\n#### Parameters {.unnumbered}\n\n**Standard free energy vs. ([D])** — monomer (LEA)\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ(D)=\\Delta G^\\circ(\\mathrm{H_2O})-m,D\n\\tag{2.1}\n$$\n\n**Multimer (F_n \\rightleftharpoons nU)** — mass action (solve (f_U))\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ + RT\\ln!\\left(\\frac{n,f_U^{,n}}{P_t^{,n-1}(1-f_U)}\\right)=0\n\\tag{2.2}\n$$\n\\\n\n* (n): number of monomers in (F_n);\n* (P_t): *monomer-equivalent* concentration (in M);\n* Eq.

The simulator allows observation of the effect of compatible osmolytes (e.g., glycine, sorbitol, sucrose, betaine) on the resulting plots.
