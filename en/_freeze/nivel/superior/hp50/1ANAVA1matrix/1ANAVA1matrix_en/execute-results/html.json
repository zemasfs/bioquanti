In this approach, comparisons are based on the measurement of error variability between groups and the variability observed within each group.\n|   ANOVA can be conducted for different types of experimental designs, with the most common being one-way ANOVA (single criterion or factor of variation) and two-way ANOVA (two factors of variation).\n\n|   The *1ANAVA1matrix* program computes the parameters and *p-value* for a one-way ANOVA, requiring only the input of a data matrix (column vectors).\n\n## Files:\n\n1.

F: value of Snedecor's F distribution;\n6. p: p-value;\n7. R²: coefficient of determination.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n|   The compressed file includes an example of results from a randomized experiment (Vieira, 2000, p. 39).\n\\\n\n::: {#fig-SimPlot layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Insertion of data matrix.](dados.jpeg){#fig-dados}\n\n![ANOVA results obtained.](result.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\n*1ANAVA1matrix* program running on the Android version of the HP50G calculator ([Go49gp](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp)), showing data input and the results for the example.\n\n:::\n\\\n\n|   The results obtained are consistent with those reported in the reference (Vieira, 2000).\n\n## References:\n\n1.
