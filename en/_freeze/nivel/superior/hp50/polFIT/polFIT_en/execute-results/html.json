Unlike the linear Van’t Hoff profile, they indicate changes in the heat capacity of the system and exhibit a curvilinear behavior that can be modeled using polynomial fitting.\n\n|   The *polFIT* program performs polynomial regression using data provided as lists and a user-defined polynomial degree, presenting statistical fitting parameters as well as the scatter plot with the fitted curve superimposed.\n\\\n\n## Equation\n\n|   Considering a general second-degree polynomial:\n\n$$\ny = a + b x + c x^2\n$$\n\n|   It is possible to approximate the thermodynamic quantities $\\Delta H$ (enthalpy), $\\Delta S$ (entropy), and $\\Delta C_p$ (heat capacity) that describe the phenomenon as a function of temperature using the relationships below (Waelbroeck and Van Obberghen, 1979):\n\\\n\n$$\n\\Delta G = a + bT + cT^2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta S = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta G}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = -(b + 2cT)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta H = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G/T)}{\\partial (1/T)}\\right)_p\n= \\Delta G + T \\Delta S\n= a - cT^2\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta C_p = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\Delta H}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = -2cT\n$$\n\\\n\n|   Thus, by solving for the polynomial coefficients, the thermodynamic quantities involved in the process can be obtained.\n\n## Files\n\n1.

[Source codes: main program and plotting routines](polFIT.pdf)\n   \\\n\n## Usage and example\n\n|   From a list of *x* values, a list of *y* values, and the polynomial degree, *polFIT* returns several fitting parameters. Two additional programs, *polPlot* and *polRes*, generate respectively the scatter plot with the fitted curve and the regression residual plot. The program requires the following data to be entered sequentially on the stack:\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Input:\n\n1. List of \"x\" values;\n2. List of \"y\" values;\n3. Polynomial degree.\n```\n:::\n\n\n|   When running *polFIT*, the following outputs are generated:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Output:\n\n1. coef: polynomial coefficients;\n2. se: standard errors of the coefficients;\n3. qmreg: mean square of the regression;\n4. sqres.sse: sum of squared errors (SSE);\n5. qmres.s2: mean square of residuals;\n6. sst: total sum of squares;\n7. r2: coefficient of determination;\n8. F: Snedecor’s F value;\n9. pval: p-value of the regression.\n```\n:::\n\n\n|   The polynomial fitting of the example data yields the quantities and graphical profiles illustrated below.\n\n::: {#fig-Therm layout-ncol=4}\n\n![Input of example data.](dados.jpeg){#fig-dados}\n\n![Resulting statistical parameters.](result.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\n![Scatter plot with fitted curve.](plot.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\n![Residual plot.](res.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\nExecution of the *polFIT* program applied to the example, illustrating data input, statistical results, fitted curve, and residual analysis.\n\n:::\n\n|   For the second-degree polynomial fit, the estimated coefficients were *a* = −158.24, *b* = 7.99, and *c* = −6.5 × 10$^{-2}$. Substituting these values into the equations above, the thermodynamic quantities at 50 K are $\\Delta H$ = −20.1 kJ/mol, $\\Delta S$ = 1.5 J/mol/K, and $\\Delta C_p$ = 6.5 J/mol.\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n1.
