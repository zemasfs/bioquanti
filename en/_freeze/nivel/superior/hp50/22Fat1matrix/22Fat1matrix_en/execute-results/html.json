The most common designs involve two, three, or four levels The *22fat1matrix* program was developed specifically to test two factors with 2 levels each.\n\\\n\n\n## Equation:\n\n| The statistical model for a 2² factorial experiment is:\n\n\n$$\nY_{ijk} = \\mu + \\alpha_i + \\beta_j + (\\alpha\\beta)_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ijk}\n$$\n\\\n\n*Where:*\n\n- $i = 1,2$ (levels of factor A)\n- $j = 1,2$ (levels of factor B)\n- $k = 1,2,\\dots,r$ (replicas)\n- $\\mu$ is the overall mean\n- $\\alpha_i$ is the effect of factor A\n- $\\beta_j$ is the effect of factor B\n- $(\\alpha\\beta)_{ij}$ is the interaction effect\n- $\\varepsilon_{ijk} \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)$ is the experimental error\n\\\n\n| The above equation is also mirrored in the *multiple linear regression* model, as follows:\n\n$$\nM_(x1,x2)=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+\\beta_2x_2+\\beta_{12}x_1x_2+error_{(x1,x2)}\n$$\n\\\n\n| Thus, a 2² factorial experiment can be solved algebraically using the multilinear adjustment model. In this case, solving by matrix relation:\n\\\n\n\n\n|   Solving by a matrix relationship:\n\n$$\nX^{T} \\cdot y = \\beta\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n* $X^{T}$ = transpose of the planning coefficient matrix;\n* $y$ = response matrix of the experimental design;\n* $\\beta$ = matrix of resulting coefficients.\n\n|   The mathematical operation involved in factorial design resembles a multiple linear regression between variables, although using a *planning coefficient matrix* translated directly from the experimental values (Neto, 1996).\n\\\n\n|   The resulting $\\beta$ matrix comprises:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\"beta matrix:\"\n\nM  - overall mean;\nA  - effect of factor A;\nB  - effect of factor B;\nAB - interaction effect.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Files:\n\n1. [22Fat1matrix program and example with planning matrix)](22Fat1matrix.zip)\n2. [Program source code](22Fat1matrix.pdf)\n\\\n\n## Usage and example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Input:\n1. Enter the matrix containing the dataset;\n2. Run the program \"22fat1matrix\".\n\n# Output:\n1. Values of M, A, B, and AB.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n*Note:* The *ex22fat* file included in *22fat1matrix.zip* refers only to the planning matrix of the example provided. For user-defined data, a new planning matrix must be constructed and stored in the variable *ex22fat* (Neto et al., 1996).\n\n::: {#fig-fat22 layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Insertion of data matrix.](dados.jpeg){#fig-dados}\n\n![Results obtained from the 2² factorial design.](result.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\n*22fat1matrix* program running on the Android version of the HP50G calculator ([Go49gp](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp)), showing data matrix input and the results for the overall mean, main effects A and B, and interaction AB.\n\n:::\n\\\n\n|   In the example (Neto *et al.*, 1995), factor *A* corresponds to the reaction temperature, whereas factor *B* represents the type of catalyst used in a chemical reaction. The values in the data matrix (input) correspond to reaction yield. In summary, the results indicate that increasing temperature led to a proportional increase in yield (A = 22.5), particularly when using catalyst *A* (while *B* was reduced), whereas changing the catalyst negatively affected yield (B = −13.5). The results are identical to those reported in the reference source (Neto *et al.*, 1996).\n\n## References:\n\n1. Neto, B. B., Scarmino, I. S., Bruns, R.
