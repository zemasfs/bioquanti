The algorithm calculates the time evolution of S, ES, and P, and plots the kinetic profile showing substrate depletion and product formation.\n|   Data input requires a subroutine written in postfix (RPN) syntax defining the system of differential equations (see figure).\n\n\\\n\n|   Example of input and output:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Inputs \n  k1 = 1000;\n  km1 = 0.1;\n  k2 = 0.05;\n  E0 = 0.005;\n  tol = 1e-5 (tolerance);\n  x = 0 (initial time);\n  y = [0.001 0 0] (initial vector for S, ES and P)\n  F - RPN subroutine defining the 3 equations\n  \n  Run \"kinMM\"\n  \n\n# Outputs:\n  Plot of t vs S and P;\n  Matrix containing S, ES, P and t values on the stack;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Files\n\n1.
