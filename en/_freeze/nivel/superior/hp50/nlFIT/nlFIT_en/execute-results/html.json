The program was adapted from the DATFIT code (Coffin, 1995) and is archived at the [hpcalc.org](https://www.hpcalc.org) portal at this [link](https://www.hpcalc.org/search.php?query=nlFIT). Its main workflow and distinctive features are summarized below:\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Program logic:\n\n1. Direct data input on the stack as lists, without the need for forms\n   (INFORM);\n2. The number of iterations is requested at the initial input;\n3. Only a single data input is required, unlike the original code;\n4. The iteration index is displayed in the upper-left corner of the\n   graphics screen;\n5. The program outputs:\n     a. covariance matrix;\n     b. estimated parameter values;\n     c. standard deviations of the parameters;\n     d. chi-square value of the regression;\n     e. list of xi values;\n     f. list of y_calc values;\n     g. graphics screen with experimental data points;\n     h. nonlinear fitted curve superimposed on the data points;\n6. Uses the FDER and PGALL subroutines (Coffin, 1995) for symbolic\n   differentiation of the fitting function and for clearing previously\n   stored variables, respectively (the original program requires three\n   subprograms);\n7. Plots experimental data using a routine that does not require ΣDAT\n   (PIXON).\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Files\n\n1. [nlFIT program and example](nlFIT.zip)\n2. [Source code](nlFIT.pdf)\n   \\\n\n|   To run the program, the following data must be entered sequentially on the stack:\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data input\n\n1. list of xi values: {x1 x2 ... xn};\n2. list of yi values: {y1 y2 y3 ... yn};\n3. list of weights: {w1 w2 w3 ... wn};\n   Note: if no weighting is required, enter a unitary list {1 1 1 ...};\n4. fitting function (e.g., Vm*x/(Km+x); Michaelis–Menten equation for\n   enzyme kinetics);\n   Note: the independent variable must be named \"x\";\n5. list of parameters: {p1 p2};\n   Note: in the example, p1 = Vm and p2 = Km;\n6. desired number of iterations (e.g., 3).\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n|   The compressed file also includes an enzyme kinetics example to illustrate usage. The data correspond to the *L. minor* nitrogen uptake dataset, as presented in the `nlstools` package of the statistical computing environment [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Program usage\n\n1. Select EVAL on the example file to load the required input lists;\n2. Run \"nlFIT\" to execute the program;\n\nNote: for user-provided data, simply replace the lists.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Results\n\n::: {#fig-nlFIT layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Results.](results.png){#fig-result}\n\n![Scatter plot and nonlinear fit.](plot.png){#fig-plot}\n\nHP50G screens showing the textual and graphical results produced by *nlFIT*.\n\n:::\n\\\n\n|   The nonlinear fitting results obtained with the *nlFIT* program are nearly identical to those obtained using the statistical software `R`, as shown in the table below. Notably, *nlFIT* required only 3 iterations, compared to 7 iterations in `R`.\n\n| Parameter    | nlFIT           | R               |\n| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- |\n| Km           | 17.089 ± 0.469  | 17.079 ± 2.953  |\n| Vm           | 126.055 ± 1.146 | 126.033 ± 7.173 |\n| Iterations   | 3               | 7               |\n| $\\chi$$^{2}$ | 234.350         | 234.375         |\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\nCoffin, Dan. *Calculus on the HP 48G/GX*.
