Unlike *SimPlot*, however, it offers three-dimensional *wireframe* visualization using the *FAST3D* command.\n\\\n\n## Equation\n\n$$\nz = f(x, y)\n$$\n\\\n\n|   For data input, the equation must be written in a specific format, as shown below:\n\n$$\nF(X,Y,k) = \\text{function}\n$$\n\n|   The function must explicitly include the parameter *k* and a list of its values. It should also be noted that, if the addition operation *+* is required, it must be written as *ADD*.\n\n## Files:\n\n1. [SimPlot3D program and example](SimPlot3D.zip)\n2. [Program source code](SimPlot3D.pdf)\n   \\\n\n## Usage and example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Input:\n1. Formatted function; e.g., \"F(X,Y,k) = (X*k)/(Y ADD X)\";\n2. List containing the limits of variables x and y; e.g., {0.1 2 0.5 5};\n3. List of values for variation of parameter \"k\"; e.g., {0.5 1 2};\n4. Run \"SimPlot3D\".\n\n# Output:\n1. 3D wireframe plot for each value of \"k\"; switching between plots\n   is performed by pressing the EXIT key on the graphics screen;\n2. Function and lists remaining on the stack for further modification.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n|   The figures below correspond to the example provided in the compressed file.\n\n::: {#fig-SimPlot3D layout-ncol=4}\n\n![Data input.](dados.jpeg){#fig-dados}\n\n![3D plot with the first value of k.
