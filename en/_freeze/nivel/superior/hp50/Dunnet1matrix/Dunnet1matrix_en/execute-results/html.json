As with other *post-hoc* tests, Dunnett’s test is considered conservative and requires a prior ANOVA to be conducted. The test relies on a *specific t-table* that depends on the number of treatments.\n\\\n\n## Equation:\n\n$$\ndms = d \\sqrt{\\frac{2qmr}{r}}\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n* *dms* = minimum significant difference;\n* *qmr* = mean square of residuals;\n* *d* = tabulated critical value (5% significance level).\n  \\\n\n## Files:\n\n1. [Dunnet1matrix program, critical *d* table, and 1ANAVA1matrix](Dunnet1matrix.zip)\n2. [Program source code](Dunnet1matrix.pdf)\n3. [Table of critical *d* values at 5% significance](tab-dcrit.pdf)\n   \\\n\n## Usage and example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Input:\n1. Enter a matrix containing the dataset;\n   Note: the control group must be placed in the 1st column of the matrix;\n2. Run the program \"1ANAVA1matrix\" from the main page (\"hp50\");\n3. Run the program \"Dunnet1matrix\".\n\n# Output:\n1. Statistical quantities: sqtr, sqt, qmtr, qmr;\n2. F-value;\n3. p-value;\n4. R², coefficient of determination;\n5. Results of comparisons between each treatment and the control group\n   (positive values indicate significant differences);\n6. dcrit5%: calculated value from the distribution;\n7. dms: minimum significant difference;\n8. \"HSD\": minimum significant difference value;\n9. Matrix containing comparison values for each pair of groups.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n::: {#fig-Dunnet layout-ncol=3}\n\n![Insertion of data matrix.](dados.jpeg){#fig-dados}\n\n![ANOVA results obtained.](anava.jpeg){#fig-anava}\n\n![Results of Dunnett’s test.](result.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\n*Dunnet1matrix* program running on the Android version of the HP50G calculator ([Go49gp](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp)), showing data input, ANOVA, and test results.\n:::\n\\\n\n|   The *dms* result is identical to that reported in the reference source (Vieira, 2000).\n\n## References:\n\n1.
