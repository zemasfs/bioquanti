B* = probability that model B is better than model A (range 0–1);\n* *$\\Delta$AIC* = difference AIC$_B$ − AIC$_A$.\n  \\\n\n## Files\n\n1. [AIC program](AIC.zip)\n2. [Source code](AIC.pdf)\n\n## Usage:\n\n|   To run the program, the following data must be entered sequentially into the stack:\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data input\n\n1. After selecting \"AIC\", the program requests the following values (INPUT):\n   n, kA, kB, ssA, ssB\n2. After ENTER, the program computes:\n   \"AIC_A, AIC_B, delta, prob.B\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Example\n\n|   The table and figures below refer, respectively, to enzyme inhibition data reported by Bezerra *et al.* (2013), and to the data input and output obtained for a pair of competing models.\n\\\n\n*Table 1 – Experimental enzyme inhibition data (n = 105).
