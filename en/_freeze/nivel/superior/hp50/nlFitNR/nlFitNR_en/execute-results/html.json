It uses an iterative procedure based on a first-order (truncated) Taylor expansion and solves for a parameter update vector that reduces the sum of squared residuals.\n\n|   The *Newton–Raphson algorithm* implemented here follows these steps: (1) symbolic differentiation of the model with respect to each parameter, (2) numerical evaluation of these derivatives from user-provided seeds, (3) construction of the resulting *Jacobian matrix* of total derivatives, and (4) computation of the update $\\Delta a$ between the current parameter estimate and its seed, together with associated errors.\n\n|   This program is similar to [nlFIT](https://www.hpcalc.org/search.php?query=nlFIT) hosted at [hpcalc.org](https://www.hpcalc.org), but differs by: (1) using a different algorithm, (2) being ~30% shorter, (3) allowing one iteration at a time (useful given the slowness of RPL on physical hardware), (4) not including an automatic stopping criterion, (5) reporting parameters and their errors at each iteration, and (6) providing a separate plotting program to be run after the user decides that enough iterations have been performed. In short, it is a distinct algorithm and codebase, offering finer execution control. The implementation is based on the NLFIT algorithm adapted from Wickes (1992, p.666).\n\n## Equation\n\n|   Using a first-order Taylor expansion around $a_0$, the model can be linearized as:\n\n$$\n\\phi(x,a)\\approx\\phi(x,a_0)+\\sum_{j=1}^{p}\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\phi(x,a)}{\\partial a_j}\\right|_{a_0},\\Delta a_j\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n* $\\phi(x,a)$ = model (fitting) equation\n* $a_j$ = model parameters\n* $a_0$ = parameter seed (or the parameter vector at iteration $i$)\n* $\\Delta a_j$ = parameter update for $a_j$\n\n\\\n\n|   Defining the Jacobian entries as:\n\n$$\nX_{ij}=\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\phi(x_i,a)}{\\partial a_j}\\right|_{a_0}\n$$\n\n|   the linearized least-squares step has the form:\n\n$$\ny \\approx X,\\Delta a\n$$\n\n|   where $X$ is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at $(x_i,a_0)$.\n\n\\\n\n## Files and example\n\n1. [nlFitNR and PLT programs, and example](nlFitNR.zip)\n2. [Source code](nlFitNR.pdf)\n\n\\\n\n|   The program runs independently. The final plot (points plus fitted curve) is produced by a separate program (*PLT*). To use *nlFitNR*, the following items must be placed on the stack in order:\n\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Input data (stack order)\n\n1. list of x_i values: {x1 x2 ... xn};\n2. list of y_i values: {y1 y2 ... yn};\n3. list of weights: {w1 w2 ... wn}.\n   Note: if no weights are used, enter a unit list: {1 1 ... 1};\n4. fitting function (e.g., Vm*x/(Km+x) for Michaelis–Menten).\n   Note: use \"x\" as the independent variable;\n5. list of parameters: {p1 p2}.\n   In the example: p1 = Vm and p2 = Km;\n6. list of parameter seeds.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n|   The example data come from the *L.minor* dataset (nitrogen uptake by macrophytes), as presented in the `nlstools` package of the statistical software [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).\n\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# How to run\n\n1. Press EVAL on the example file to unpack the input lists;\n2. Run \"nlFitNR\";\n3. The program outputs:\n   a. updated parameters (stack);\n   b. \"sd-RSE\"  - residual variance of the fit;\n   c. \"+/- se\"  - standard errors of the parameters;\n   d. \"Chi2\"    - chi-square value of the fit;\n\n4. If satisfied, interrupt the program (KILL) and inspect the plot.\n   If not, run one more iteration by pressing \"CONT\".\n\nNote: for your own data, simply replace the input lists.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Results\n\n::: {#fig-nlFitNR layout-ncol=3}\n\n![Data entry.

Subsequent iterations reduce the parameter uncertainties but may increase the global fit error. Values matching those obtained with `R` were reached by the third iteration.\n\n\\\n\n| Parameter  | nlFitNR       | R               |\n| ---------- | ------------- | --------------- |\n| Km         | 12.01 ± 0.71  | 17.079 ± 2.953  |\n| Vm         | 117.51 ± 3.17 | 126.033 ± 7.173 |\n| Iterations | 1             | 7               |\n| $\\chi^{2}$ | 124.29        | 234.375         |\n\n\\\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n1.
