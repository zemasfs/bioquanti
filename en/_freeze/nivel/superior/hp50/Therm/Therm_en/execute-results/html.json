It was developed using the [newRPL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/newrpl/) *firmware*, although it can be easily adapted to the original HP50G firmware.\n\\\n\n## Equation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^{T_1} = \\Delta H - T_1 \\cdot \\Delta S\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^{T_2} = \\Delta H - T_2 \\cdot \\Delta S\n$$\n\\\n\n|   The solution is obtained via matrix algebra:\n\n$$\nA \\cdot x = b\n$$\n\n*Where:*\n\n* *A* = matrix containing temperature values and a unitary first column;\n* *b* = column matrix with $\\Delta G$ values;\n* *x* = resulting matrix containing the parameters $\\Delta S$ and $\\Delta H$.\n\n## Files:\n\n1. [Therm program](Therm.zip)\n2. [Program source code](Therm.pdf)\n   \\\n\n## Usage:\n\n|   To run the program, the following data must be entered sequentially on the stack:\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data input\n\n1. DeltaG_1, T1, DeltaG_2, T2;\n2. After selecting \"Therm\", the program computes the values of DeltaS and DeltaH.\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Example\n\n|   The figure below illustrates the HP50G with data input and the resulting stack output for the reaction described in Cooper (2011), as well as the *newRPL firmware* layout.\n\\\n\n::: {#fig-Therm layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Input of DeltaG and T1, and DeltaG and T2 values.](dados.jpeg){#fig-dados}\n\n![Results obtained from the program.](result.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\nExecution of the *Therm* program to obtain $\\Delta S$ and $\\Delta H$ for a chemical reaction at two temperatures (*newRPL firmware*). The results are consistent with those reported by the author (Cooper, 2011).\n\n:::\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n1. Cooper, Alan. *Biophysical Chemistry*.
