As in previous programs, data input is performed using a single matrix (column vectors only).\n\n## Files:\n\n1. [2ANAVA1matrix program and example](2ANAVA1matrix.zip)\n2. [Program source code](2ANAVA1matrix.pdf)\n   \\\n\n## Usage and example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Input:\n1. Data matrix (column vectors);\n2. \"2ANAVA1matrix\"\n\n# Output:\n1. sqtr: treatment sum of squares;\n2. sqb: block sum of squares;\n3. sqt: total sum of squares;\n4. qmtr: treatment mean square;\n5. qmb: block mean square;\n6. qmr: residual mean square;\n7. Ftr: Snedecor’s F value for treatments;\n8. Fbl: Snedecor’s F value for blocks;\n9. p: p-value for treatments;\n10. pbl: p-value for blocks;\n11. R2: coefficient of determination of the model.\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n|   The compressed file includes an example from a randomized experimental trial (Vieira, 2000, p. 81).\n\\\n\n::: {#fig-SimPlot layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Insertion of data matrix.](dados.jpeg){#fig-dados}\n\n![Results obtained from the two-way ANOVA.](result.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\n*2ANAVA1matrix* program running on the Android version of the HP50G calculator ([Go49gp](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp)), showing data input and example results.\n\n:::\n\\\n\n|   The obtained results are identical to those reported in the reference source (Vieira, 2000).\n\n## References:\n\n1.
