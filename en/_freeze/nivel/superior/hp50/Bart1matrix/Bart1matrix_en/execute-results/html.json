The logic of the test involves computing the *T* statistic and comparing it with the predicted value from the $\\chi^2$ distribution.\n\\\n\n## Equation:\n\n$$\nT = \\frac{(N-k)\\ln(s_p^2) - \\sum_{i=1}^k (N_i-1)\\ln(s_i^2)}\n{1 + \\frac{1}{3(k-1)}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{N_i-1}\\right) - \\frac{1}{N-k}}\n$$\n\n|   With:\n$$\ns_p^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^k (N_i-1)\\frac{s_i^2}{N-k}\n$$\n\\\n\n*Where:*\n\n* $s_i^2$ = variance of group *i*;\n* $N_i$ = size of group *i*;\n* $N$ = total sample size;\n* *k* = number of groups;\n* $s_p^2$ = pooled variance.\n\n## Files:\n\n1. [Bart1matrix program and example](Bart1matrix.zip)\n2. [Program source code](Bart1matrix.pdf)\n   \\\n\n## Bart1matrix\n\n|   Based on a simple data matrix (column vectors), the program outputs the critical $\\chi^2$ value at 5% significance level ($\\alpha$ = 0.05), the *T* statistic, and the associated *p-value*.\n\n## Usage and example\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1. Enter the data matrix (column vectors);\n2. Run \"Bart1matrix\".\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n|   The compressed file includes an example comparing the dry weight of control plant groups with two treatment groups. The data were obtained from the `datasets` library of the statistical computing environment [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) — *PlantGrowth*. The figures below illustrate the execution of the program using this example dataset.\n\n::: {#fig-SimPlot layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Insertion of data matrix.](dados.jpeg){#fig-dados}\n\n![Results obtained from Bartlett’s test.](result.jpeg){#fig-result}\n\n*Bart1matrix* program running on the Android version of the HP50G calculator ([Go49gp](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp)), showing data input and results using the example dataset.\n\n:::\n\\\n\n|   When compared with results obtained using *R*, the *p-value* was 0.2371 ($\\chi^2$ = 2.966).\n\n## References:\n\n1.
