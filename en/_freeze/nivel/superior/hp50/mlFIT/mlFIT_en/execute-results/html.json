In this case, the fitting procedure determines the influence of individual factors and their combined contribution to the dependent variable. QSAR, in turn, stands for *Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship*. Essentially, it involves identifying structural features associated with a biological effect mediated by chemical compounds. By combining both approaches, QSAR can be addressed using a multiple linear regression framework.\n\\\n\n## Equation\n\n|   The general function for a multiple linear model is:\n\n$$\n\\hat{y}*{i} = b*{0} + b_{1}x_{i,1} + b_{2}x_{i,2} + \\ldots + b_{k}x_{i,k}\n$$\n\n|   The algebraic solution involves constructing the matrix containing the independent variables (with a unitary first column) and the response variable, followed by the determination of the coefficients $\\beta$ as:\n\n$$\n\\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} (X^T y)\n$$\n\\\n\n|   The *mlFIT* program takes as input the matrices *X* and *y*, and returns the coefficients $\\beta$ along with statistical parameters associated with the regression.\n\\\n\n## Files\n\n1.
