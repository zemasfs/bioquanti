When a single independent variable is involved (typically time), these derivatives are referred to as *ordinary differential equations (ODEs)*. Solving an *initial value problem* for an ODE is commonly done through numerical approximation schemes, among which the classical fourth-order *Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg* method is widely known. The *kinSite* program uses the calculator’s internal ODE solver (RKF) to model the kinetics of molecular interaction.\n\n\\\n\n## Equation\n\n|   The interaction considered here is a bimolecular ligand–receptor reaction:\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{equation}\nL+R \\begin{array}{c}\n_{k_1}\\\\\n \\rightleftharpoons\\\\\n^{k_2} \\end{array} LR \n\\end{equation}\n```\n\n\\\n\n*Where:*\n\n* *R* = free receptor (protein, nucleic acid, etc.);\n* *LR* = complex formed;\n* *k$_1$* = association rate constant;\n* *k$_2$* = dissociation rate constant.\n\n|   The *association* rates are described by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[LR]}{dt}=k_1[L][R]\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt}=-k_1[L][R]\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[R]}{dt}=-k_1[L][R]\n$$\n\n|   Likewise, the *dissociation* rates are given by:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[LR]}{dt}=-k_2[LR]\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt}=k_2[LR]\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[R]}{dt}=k_2[LR]\n$$\n\n|   At equilibrium (and, more generally, along the full time course), the *net* reaction rates are the sum of association and dissociation contributions. Therefore, the system to be solved is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[L]}{dt}=-k_1[L][R]+k_2[LR]\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[R]}{dt}=-k_1[L][R]+k_2[LR]\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{d[LR]}{dt}=k_1[L][R]-k_2[LR]\n$$\n\n|   Numerically, the evolution of ([L]), ([R]), and ([LR]) over small time steps (\\Delta t) can be computed from a system of differential equations in vector form:\n\n$$\n\\Delta x=f(x),\\Delta t\n$$\n\n\\\n\n## kinSite\n\n|   The program uses the HP50G RKF routine (Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg) to solve the ODE system numerically. The algorithm computes ([L]), ([R]), and ([LR]) along time and plots the resulting kinetic curves. Data entry requires a subroutine containing the ODE system written in *postfix* (RPN) syntax (figure).\n\n\\\n\n|   Example inputs and outputs are:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Inputs\n  k1 = 0.02;\n  k2 = 0.001;\n  tol = 1e-5 (tolerance);\n  x = 0 (initial time);\n  y = [0.8 1 0] (initial vector for L, R, and LR);\n  F  (RPN subroutine for the 3 equations)\n\n  Run \"kinSite\"\n\n# Outputs\n  Plot of t vs. L, R, and LR;\n  Matrix of computed values on the stack;\n```\n:::\n\n\n\\\n\n## Files\n\n1.

Nearly identical results were obtained in ~1 s using the approach described by Prinz (2011, ch. 6) with [Octave](https://octave.org/) (function *lsode*).\n\n\\\n\n::: {#fig-kinSite layout-ncol=3}\n\n![Subroutine containing the three differential equations for ligand–receptor interaction.](F.png){#fig-F}\n\n![Kinetic curves for L, R, and LR.](plot.png){#fig-plot}\n\n![Matrix with values of L, R, LR, and t.](result.png){#fig-result}\n\n*kinSite* running on the Android HP50G emulator ([Go49gp](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp)), illustrating ligand–receptor kinetics for a one-site model with the provided example.\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n1.
