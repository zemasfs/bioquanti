Experimentally, it can be estimated by kinetic or electrokinetic measurements such as *zeta potential*, isoelectric focusing, or capillary electrophoresis.\n|   In a related sense, the *isoionic point* refers to the same condition *in the absence of an electric field*, and may be inferred from potentiometric titration, viscosity, or directly from the structural information encoded in a monomeric sequence, as in the primary sequence of proteins. The program *qNet* simulates a titration curve for peptide (and protein) sequences.\n\n\\\n\n## Equation\n\n|   The net charge of a compound, *qNet*, can be expressed as the sum of its acidic (*qa*) and basic (*qb*) contributions:\n\n$$\nqNet = qb + qa\n$$\n\n\\\n\n*Where:*\n\n* *qb* = charge in the basic form (+1, 0, or −1)\n\n\\\n\n|   Considering the ionization of chemical groups via the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation:\n\n$$\npH = pK_a + \\log\\left(\\frac{A^-}{HA}\\right)\n$$\n\n\\\n\n*Where:*\n\n* $pK_a = -\\log[H^+]$\n* *HA* = acid form concentration\n* *A$^-$* = base form concentration\n\n\\\n\n|   For a set of ionizable groups in a molecule, an operational expression for *qNet* can be written as:\n\n$$\nqNet=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\n\\left(\nq_{b,i}\n+\n\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{,pH - pK_i}}\n\\right)\n$$\n\n\\\n\n|   Thus, *qNet* is computed from the input values of $q_{b,i}$, $pK_i$, and $n$ (the multiplicity/amount of ionizable groups of type *i* in the sequence).\n\n\\\n\n## Use and example\n\n|   Plotting is performed by an independent program, *plotF*, which allows the user to plot a mathematical function by placing the expression on the stack along with the initial and final values of the independent variable.\n\n|   In this way, *qNet* supports data input and generates a net-charge curve as a function of pH. For program execution, example inputs and outputs are:\n\n\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Inputs\n1.
