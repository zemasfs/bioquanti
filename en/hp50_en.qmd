|   This section is not strictly related to didactic–scientific tools for *reproducible teaching*, and is included here primarily as a tribute to the legacy of programmable scientific calculators that for decades have supported scientific research and teaching–learning processes across various areas of the Exact Sciences and the Natural Sciences.

|   Tangential to these initiatives, the use of programmable calculators reached remarkable milestones, such as the *HP-41C* model by Hewlett-Packard, which was used in [nine U.S. Space Shuttle missions](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/calculator-hand-held-hp-41/nasm_A19890003000) during the [1980s](https://literature.hpcalc.org/community/hpdigest-vol8.pdf).

|   In this spirit, below are *selected programs developed* by the author for the *HP50G* model, released in 2006. The calculator is programmable in the [RPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPL_%28programming_language%29) language, a hybrid of *RPN – Reverse Polish Notation* and [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29). Although discontinued in 2015, it remains available in online marketplaces and in the devoted hearts of its admirers — among whom this humble acolyte gladly shares the healthy addiction (*heritage nerd*).

\

|   In the years surrounding the discontinuation of the HP50G, a highly active online community collaborated to consolidate a new *firmware* for the calculator, culminating in the [newRPL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/newrpl/) project. This firmware was developed in C/C++ and targets both the original calculator and its successor, the [Prime](https://support.hp.com/br-pt/product/details/null/model/7298644), as well as desktop and mobile platforms. Although the current version lacks differential calculus, statistical distributions, and graphical editing features present in the original firmware, it stands out for its enhanced editing capabilities (8-level undo/redo), 16 grayscale levels, local variables in programming (LSTO), improved command editing, a dedicated financial mathematics menu (replicating the classic [HP12C](https://www.hp.com/br-pt/shop/calculadora-financeira-hp-12c-f2230a.html)), two independent action menus, command autocompletion, 2000-digit precision, extended numerical limits (10$^{-30000}$ to 10$^{30000}$), and significantly faster processing speed than the original firmware (192 MHz versus 75 MHz — approximately 10–12× faster, according to its developers).

## Programs for HP50G: <span style="color:red">(under construction)</span> {.unnumbered}

|   The programs listed below were developed by the author over several years. They are reproducible on physical HP49G and HP50G calculators, as well as in *versions* for [desktop](https://www.hpcalc.org/hp49/pc/emulators/) or [mobile devices](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp). Some programs run on the original *firmware*, while others use the more recent *newRPL* version (2021).
