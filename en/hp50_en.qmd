|   This section is not directly related to didactic–scientific tools for *reproducible teaching*. It is included as a tribute to the remarkable arsenal of programmable scientific calculators that long supported scientific research and teaching–learning across several fields of the Exact Sciences and the Natural Sciences.

|   Tangential to these initiatives, the use of programmable calculators reached its peak in a number of singular moments, such as the Hewlett-Packard *HP-41C* model, which was used in [nine U.S. Space Shuttle missions](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/calculator-hand-held-hp-41/nasm_A19890003000) during the [1980s](https://literature.hpcalc.org/community/hpdigest-vol8.pdf).

|   In that spirit, below are *some programs developed* by the author for the *HP50G* model, released by the manufacturer in 2006. The calculator can be programmed in [RPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPL_%28programming_language%29), a blend of *RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)* and [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29). Although discontinued in 2015, it can still be found both in online marketplaces and in the passionate hearts of its admirers—among whom this humble devotee shares the healthy addiction (*heritage nerd*).

\

|   In the years close to the HP50G discontinuation, a very active online community joined forces to consolidate a new *firmware* for the calculator, culminating in the [newRPL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/newrpl/) project. The new *firmware* was developed in C/C++ and targets the original calculator, its successor [Prime](https://support.hp.com/br-pt/product/details/null/model/7298644), as well as desktop and mobile devices. Although the current version lacks differential calculus, statistical distributions, and graph editing features found in the original firmware, it stands out for its editing capabilities (8-level undo/redo), 16 grayscale levels, local variables in programming (LSTO), improved command editing, a dedicated financial-math menu (mirroring the classic [HP12C](https://www.hp.com/br-pt/shop/calculadora-financeira-hp-12c-f2230a.html)), two independent action menus, command autocompletion, 2000-digit precision, extended numeric limits (10$^{-30000}$ to 10$^{30000}$), and a much faster processing speed than the original firmware (192 MHz vs. 75 MHz—reported as ~10–12× faster by its developers).

## Programs for HP50G: {.unnumbered}
<!-- <span style="color:red">(under construction)</span> -->

|   The programs below were developed by the author over several years. They are reproducible on physical HP49G/HP50G calculators, as well as in versions for [desktop](https://www.hpcalc.org/hp49/pc/emulators/) or [mobile devices](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp). Some programs run on the original firmware, while others target the more recent *newRPL* firmware (2021).
