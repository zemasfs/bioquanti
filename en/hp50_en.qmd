|   This section is not strictly related to didactic–scientific tools for *reproducible teaching*, and is included here primarily as a tribute to the rich legacy of programmable scientific calculators that for decades have served scientific research and teaching–learning processes across several areas of the Exact Sciences and the Natural Sciences.

|   Tangential to these initiatives, the use of programmable calculators reached its peak in several singular moments, such as with the *HP-41C* model by Hewlett-Packard, which was used in [nine U.S. Space Shuttle missions](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/calculator-hand-held-hp-41/nasm_A19890003000) during the [1980s](https://literature.hpcalc.org/community/hpdigest-vol8.pdf).

|   In this context, *some programs developed* by the author for the *HP50G* model, released in 2006, are presented below. The calculator is programmable in the [RPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPL_%28programming_language%29) language, a hybrid of *RPN – Reverse Polish Notation* and [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29). Although discontinued in 2015, it can still be found today both in electronic marketplaces and in the passionate hearts of its admirers — among whom this humble acolyte gladly shares the healthy addiction (*heritage nerd*).

\

|   In the years following the discontinuation of the HP50G, a very active online community came together to consolidate a new calculator *firmware*, culminating in the [newRPL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/newrpl/) project. This new firmware was developed in C/C++ and is intended both for the original calculator and its successor, the [Prime](https://support.hp.com/br-pt/product/details/null/model/7298644), as well as for desktop computers and mobile devices. Although the current version lacks differential calculus, statistical distributions, and graphical editing features found in the original firmware, it stands out for its advanced editing capabilities (8-level undo/redo), 16 levels of grayscale, local variables in programming (LSTO), improved command editing, a dedicated financial mathematics menu (replicating classic [HP12C](https://www.hp.com/br-pt/shop/calculadora-financeira-hp-12c-f2230a.html) functionality), two independent action menus, command autocompletion, 2000-digit precision, extended numerical limits (10$^{-30000}$ to 10$^{30000}$), and much faster processing speed than the original firmware (192 MHz versus 75 MHz — approximately 10–12× faster, according to its developers).

## Programs for HP50G: <span style="color:red">(under construction)</span> {.unnumbered}

|   The programs listed below were developed by the author over several years. They are reproducible on physical HP49G and HP50G calculators, as well as in *versions* for [desktop](https://www.hpcalc.org/hp49/pc/emulators/) or [mobile devices](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp). Some programs run on the original *firmware*, while others are written for the most recent *newRPL* version (2021).
