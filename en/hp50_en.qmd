| This tab is not related to educational and scientific tools for *reproducible teaching*, and is included only in recognition of the arsenal of programmable scientific calculators that have long served scientific research and teaching and learning in various areas of the exact and natural sciences.

| Tangential to these initiatives, the use of programmable calculators reached its peak on several unique occasions, such as the Hewlett-Packard *HP-41C* model, used in the [nine U.S. space shuttle missions](https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/calculator-hand-held-hp-41/nasm_A19890003000) in the [1980s](https://literature.hpcalc.org/community/hpdigest-vol8.pdf).

| In this regard, here are *some programs developed* by the author for the *HP50G* model, launched in 2006 by the manufacturer. The calculator is programmable in [RPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPL_(programming_language)), a mixture of *RPN - Reverse Polish Notation* and [Lisp](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp). Although it was discontinued in 2015, it can still be found today both in e-commerce and in the passionate hearts of its admirers, among whom this humble servant shares their healthy addiction (*heritage nerd*).

## Programs for HP50G: <span style="color:red">(under construction)</span> {.unnumbered}

| The programs below were developed by the author over several years. Tehy can be run on the physical versions of the HP49G and HP50G calculators, as well as on versions for [desktop](https://www.hpcalc.org/hp49/pc/emulators/) or [mobile devices](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp).
