|   Factorial design is an experimental statistical design used to assess to verify the significance of factors (e.g., pH, content, temperature, type) and levels in an experiment (e.g., value, type), without the need for complete trials with all samples.  The most common designs involve two, three, or four levels The *fat1matrix* program was developed specifically to test two levels for two factors.
\


## Equation:

$$
M_{(x_1,x_2)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_{12} x_1 x_2 + \text{error}_{(x_1,x_2)}
$$
\

|   Solving by a matrix relationship:

$$
X^{T} \cdot y = \beta
$$

*Where:*

* $X^{T}$ = transpose of the contrast coefficient matrix;
* $y$ = response matrix of the experimental design;
* $\beta$ = matrix of resulting coefficients.

|   The mathematical operation involved in factorial design resembles a multiple linear regression between variables, although using a *contrast coefficient matrix* translated directly from the experimental values (Neto, 1996).
\

|   The resulting $\beta$ matrix comprises:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
"beta matrix:"

M  - overall mean;
A  - effect of factor A;
B  - effect of factor B;
AB - interaction effect.
```

## Files:

1. [fat1matrix program and example (data and contrast matrix)](fat1matrix.zip)
2. [Program source code](fat1matrix.pdf)
3. [Example contrast matrix](c22.pdf)
   \

## Usage and example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Input:
1. Enter the matrix containing the dataset;
2. Run the program "fat1matrix".

# Output:
1. Values of M, A, B, and AB.
```

\

*Note:* The *c22* file included in *fat1matrix.zip* refers only to the contrast matrix of the example provided. For user-defined data, a new contrast matrix must be constructed and stored in the variable *c22* (Neto et al., 1996).

|   In the example (Neto *et al.*, 1995), factor *A* corresponds to the reaction temperature, whereas factor *B* represents the type of catalyst used in a chemical reaction. The values in the data matrix (input) correspond to reaction yield. In summary, the results indicate that increasing temperature led to a proportional increase in yield (A = 22.5), particularly when using catalyst *A* (while *B* was reduced), whereas changing the catalyst negatively affected yield (B = −13.5). The results are identical to those reported in the reference source (Neto *et al.*, 1996).
