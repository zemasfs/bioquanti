|   This program allows the calculation of parameters of the *Akaike Information Criterion* (Akaike, 2003) for the statistical discrimination between nonlinear models.
\

## Equation:

$$
AIC = n \cdot \ln!\left(\frac{SSE}{n}\right) + 2k + \left[\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1}\right]
$$

*Where:*

* *k* = *p* + 1 (with *p* being the number of model parameters);
* *SSE* = sum of squared residuals from the fit.
  \

$$
probab.B = \frac{e^{-0.5 \cdot \Delta AIC}}{1 + e^{-0.5 \cdot \Delta AIC}}
$$
\

*Where:*

* *probab. B* = probability that model B is better than model A (range 0–1);
* *$\Delta$AIC* = difference AIC$_B$ − AIC$_A$.

## Files

1. [AIC program](AIC.zip)
2. [Source code](AIC.pdf)

## Usage:

|   To run the program, the following data must be entered sequentially into the stack:
\

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Data input

1. After selecting "AIC", the program requests the following values (INPUT):
   n, kA, kB, ssA, ssB
2. After ENTER, the program computes:
   "AIC_A, AIC_B, delta, prob.B"
```

## Example

|   The table and figures below refer, respectively, to enzyme inhibition data reported by Bezerra *et al.* (2013), and to the data input and output obtained for a pair of competing models.

| Type | Control | Competitive | Pure non-competitive | Mixed non-competitive | Uncompetitive |

| p    | 2       | 3           | 3                    | 4                     | 3             |

Execution of the program for comparison between control and competitive models of enzyme inhibition.

:::

|   By running the *AIC* program, the following comparison results were obtained for selected pairs of models:

*Table 2 — Results of model comparison using the AIC criterion.*

| Model A / B                | AIC$_A$ | AIC$_B$ | $\Delta$ | Probab. B |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------- |
| Control / Competitive      | 288.2   | 193.7   | -94.6    | 1.0       |
| Control / Mixed NComp.     | 288.2   | 195.9   | -92.3    | 1.0       |
| Competitive / Mixed NComp. | 193.7   | 195.9   | 2.2      | 0.25      |

|   Based on these results, the probability associated with model B supports the selection of the competitive enzyme inhibition model, with a 75% likelihood over the mixed non-competitive model, in agreement with the conclusions reported by the authors.
