|   ANOVA (*Analysis of Variance*) is a widely used statistical procedure across several fields of knowledge when the objective is to assess whether or not there are significant differences among groups tested in an experiment. In this approach, comparisons are based on the measurement of error variability between groups and the variability observed within each group.
|   ANOVA can be conducted for different types of experimental designs, with the most common being one-way ANOVA (single criterion or factor of variation) and two-way ANOVA (two factors of variation).

|   The *1ANAVA1matrix* program computes the parameters and *p-value* for a one-way ANOVA, requiring only the input of a data matrix (column vectors).

## Usage and example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1. Enter the data matrix (column vectors);
2. Run "1ANAVA1matrix".
```
