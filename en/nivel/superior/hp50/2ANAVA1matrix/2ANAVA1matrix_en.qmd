|   Two-way *Analysis of Variance* (two-factor or bidimensional ANOVA) allows comparison of within-group and between-group variances for two sources of variation in a randomized block design.

|   The *2ANAVA1matrix* program computes statistical quantities including *p-values* for a two-way ANOVA (blocks). As in previous programs, data input is performed using a single matrix (column vectors only).

## Files:

1. [2ANAVA1matrix program and example](2ANAVA1matrix.zip)
2. [Program source code](2ANAVA1matrix.pdf)
   \

## Usage and example

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Input:
1. Data matrix (column vectors);
2. "2ANAVA1matrix"

# Output:
1. sqtr: treatment sum of squares;
2. sqb: block sum of squares;
3. sqt: total sum of squares;
4. qmtr: treatment mean square;
5. qmb: block mean square;
6. qmr: residual mean square;
7. Ftr: Snedecor’s F value for treatments;
8. Fbl: Snedecor’s F value for blocks;
9. p: p-value for treatments;
10. pbl: p-value for blocks;
11. R2: coefficient of determination of the model.
```
