|   Bartlett’s test evaluates whether a dataset composed of *k* groups exhibits homogeneous variance among its elements. The logic of the test involves computing the *T* statistic and comparing it with the predicted value from the $\chi^2$ distribution.
\

## Equation:

$$
T = \frac{(N-k)\ln(s_p^2) - \sum_{i=1}^k (N_i-1)\ln(s_i^2)}
{1 + \frac{1}{3(k-1)}\left(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{1}{N_i-1}\right) - \frac{1}{N-k}}
$$

|   With:
$$
s_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k (N_i-1)\frac{s_i^2}{N-k}
$$
\

*Where:*

* $s_i^2$ = variance of group *i*;
* $N_i$ = size of group *i*;
* $N$ = total sample size;
* *k* = number of groups;
* $s_p^2$ = pooled variance.

## Bart1matrix

|   Based on a simple data matrix (column vectors), the program outputs the critical $\chi^2$ value at 5% significance level ($\alpha$ = 0.05), the *T* statistic, and the associated *p-value*.

## Usage and example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1. Enter the data matrix (column vectors);
2. Run "Bart1matrix".
```

|   The compressed file includes an example comparing the dry weight of control plant groups with two treatment groups. The data were obtained from the `datasets` library of the statistical computing environment [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) — *PlantGrowth*. The figures below illustrate the execution of the program using this example dataset.

|   When compared with results obtained using *R*, the *p-value* was 0.2371 ($\chi^2$ = 2.966).
