|   This program is intentionally simple, yet it allows the simultaneous calculation of $\Delta S$ and $\Delta H$ by linear algebra for a pair of reactions occurring at different temperatures, given known values of $\Delta G$ (*linear system of equations*). It was developed using the [newRPL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/newrpl/) *firmware*, although it can be easily adapted to the original HP50G firmware.
\

## Equation:

$$
\Delta G^{T_1} = \Delta H - T_1 \cdot \Delta S
$$

$$
\Delta G^{T_2} = \Delta H - T_2 \cdot \Delta S
$$
\

|   The solution is obtained via matrix algebra:

$$
A \cdot x = b
$$

*Where:*

* *A* = matrix containing temperature values and a unitary first column;
* *b* = column matrix with $\Delta G$ values;
* *x* = resulting matrix containing the parameters $\Delta S$ and $\Delta H$.

## Usage:

|   To run the program, the following data must be entered sequentially on the stack:
\

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Data input

1. DeltaG_1, T1, DeltaG_2, T2;
2. After selecting "Therm", the program computes the values of DeltaS and DeltaH.
```

## Example

|   The figure below illustrates the HP50G with data input and the resulting stack output for the reaction described in Cooper (2011), as well as the *newRPL firmware* layout.

Execution of the *Therm* program to obtain $\Delta S$ and $\Delta H$ for a chemical reaction at two temperatures (*newRPL firmware*). The results are consistent with those reported by the author (Cooper, 2011).
