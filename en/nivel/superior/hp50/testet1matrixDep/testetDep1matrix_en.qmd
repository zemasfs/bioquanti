|   This version of Student’s *t*-test evaluates whether two dependent (paired) samples are statistically different. The only required input is the data matrix.
\

## Equation:

$$
t = \frac{d}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}}}
$$
\

*Where:*

* *d* = mean difference between paired observations
* *s²* = variance of the differences
* *n* = sample size

|   The variance of the differences is given by:

$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum d^2 - \frac{(\sum d)^2}{n}}{n - 1}
$$

2. [Program source code](testetDep1matrix.pdf)
   \

## Usage and example

|   The program performs the test at a 5% significance level.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1. Enter the matrix containing the two paired datasets;
2. Run "testetDep1matrix"

# Output:
1. "tval" – calculated t statistic;
2. "tcr5%" – critical (tabulated) t value at 5%;
3. "pval" – p-value of the test
```
