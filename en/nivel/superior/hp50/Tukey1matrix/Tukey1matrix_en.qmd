|   Tukey’s HSD (*Honestly Significant Difference*) test is one of the most widely used *post-hoc* procedures when the goal is to determine whether there are statistically distinct group(s) within a sample, based on pairwise comparisons. As with other *post-hoc* tests, Tukey’s HSD is performed after conducting an ANOVA.

|   It is considered a conservative test and relies on the *studentized range* distribution (*q* table). The standard Tukey–HSD test is applied when groups have equal sample sizes. For unequal group sizes, its extension—the *Tukey–Kramer* test—is used.

## Equation:

$$
HSD = q_{(df,k)} \frac{qmr}{r}
$$

*Where:*

* *df* = degrees of freedom of the sample (*n − k*);
* *k* = number of groups;
* *r* = number of observations per group
* *qmr* = mean square of residuals;
* *q* = critical value from the studentized range distribution (*q*-critical).

2. [Program source code](Tukey1matrix.pdf)
3. [Table of *q*-critical values](tab-qcrit.pdf)
   \

## Usage and example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Input:
1. Enter a matrix containing the dataset;
2. Run the program "1ANAVA1matrix" from the main page ("hp50");
3. Run the program "Tukey1matrix".

# Output:
1. "qcrit5%" – value from the *q* distribution;
2. "HSD" – minimum significant difference;
3. Matrix containing comparison values for each pair of groups.
```

\

|   Pairs are considered significantly different when:

$$
\Delta AB > HSD
$$
