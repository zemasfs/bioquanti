|   Fisher’s LSD (*Least Significant Difference*) test is a *post-hoc* procedure for multiple comparisons of paired treatment means based on Student’s *t* distribution. A pairwise absolute difference between treatments is considered significant whenever it exceeds the critical LSD value (called *DMS* in Portuguese).
\

## Equation:

$$
LSD = t_{(\alpha,, df)} \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot qmr}{r}}
$$

*Where*

* *LSD* = least significant difference (minimum significant difference);
* *k* = number of groups (with degrees of freedom for treatments (df_{tr} = k - 1));
* *r* = number of observations per group;
* *qmr* = residual mean square;
* *t* = critical value from Student’s *t* distribution.

## Usage and example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Input:
1. Data matrix containing the dataset;
2. Run the program "1ANAVA1matrix" from the main page ("hp50");
3. Run the program "Fish1matrix".

# Output:
1. "lsd" – least significant difference value;
2. Matrix containing comparison values for each pair of groups.
```

\

|   Pairwise comparisons are automated in the program. Pairs are considered significantly different when:

$$
\Delta AB > LSD
$$

*Fish1matrix* program running on the Android version of the HP50G calculator ([Go49gp](https://sites.google.com/site/olivier2smet2/home/go49gp)), showing data input, ANOVA output, Fisher’s LSD results, and the pairwise comparison worksheet. The matrix contains columns *A*, *B*, values of $\Delta AB$, and the corresponding LSD thresholds.
